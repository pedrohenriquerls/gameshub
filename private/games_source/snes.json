Each half can be set up for a duration of up to five minutes.There is a \"lifting game\" included in the options mode that allows players to balance a soccer ball on his virtual body for points like in an arcade game. The names of the moves are in Japanese; making it unlikely for Westerners to comprehend their moves. The highest score ever achieved in this mode was 59780 points and it was captured on YouTube on September 6, 2007. Easy moves are worth ten points each while the most difficult moves are 200 points each.[1]There was a relatively elaborate television commercial for this game that appeared on Japanese television during the second quarter of 1993. It would show the Namco logo followed by the box art appearing out from underneath a soccer stadium full of players to the tune of Olé, Olé, Olé.In November 1993, Famitsu magazine's Reader Cross Review gave the game an 8 out of 10.[2]J.

A sequel, ActRaiser 2, was released for the Super Nintendo in 1993. In 2007, ActRaiser became available on the Wii's Virtual Console download service in Europe, North America, and Japan. A version of the game was also released for European mobile phones in 2004.After the original Japanese version, the first release was the North American version. This is where the bulk of the changes appear. Here, the game's title was slightly changed to ActRaiser, with a new logo to match. Some graphical censoring was made, such as the Monster Lairs being changed from Stars of David to skull-like symbols. Gameplay was changed as well, specifically in the action segments: they possess overall easier level design, various enemies were given new attacks, spells require less magic to cast, spike pits do not instantly kill the player, and more time is given to finish each segment. However, the simulation segments have been made harder; for example, it is very difficult to reach the maximum experience level in this version. Finally, there is a \"Professional!\" mode, unlocked after completing the game; this mode only contains the action segments, and the level design is similar to the original Japanese release but with the other changes from the main mode.ActRaiser also became available on the Wii's Virtual Console. It was released in Japan on March 20, 2007, in Europe on April 13, 2007, and in North America on May 28, 2007.[5][6][7] As the game was published by Enix, Square Enix currently holds the rights to the Virtual Console edition.ActRaiser was awarded Best Music of 1993 by Electronic Gaming Monthly.[12] On December 12, 2003 ActRaiser was inducted into GameSpot's Greatest Games of All Time.[13] It was rated the 150th best game made on a Nintendo System in Nintendo Power's Top 200 Games list.[14]In 2007, ScrewAttack ranked ActRaiser #1 on their \"Top 10 Big Names That Fell Off\", which listed games that in days past were extremely popular, whether good or bad, but have since all but faded away (Actraiser was described in a decidedly good way).[15] It was also #10 in their \"Top 20 SNES Games\" list.[16]","title":"ActRaiser","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/42/ActRaiser_Coverart.png","developer":"Quintet","genre":"Action"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActRaiser_2","description":"ActRaiser 2, released in Japan as ActRaiser 2: Chinmoku e no Seisen (アクトレイザー2 沈黙への聖戦?, lit. \"ActRaiser 2: The Crusade for Silence\"), is a side-scrolling platform game for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System video game console developed by Quintet and published by Enix (now Square Enix) in 1993, and is the followup to the popular game ActRaiser.The storyline relation of ActRaiser 2 is not explicitly revealed; however, many plot details suggest that ActRaiser 2 may actually be a prequel to the original ActRaiser, or take place in another universe entirely. Otherwise, the given story draws concepts from the famous religious epics Paradise Lost and the Divine Comedy.Unlike the original game, which alternately combined platform game sequences and god game sequences, ActRaiser 2 is only a platform game. It is believed that this game was made by request from Enix of America to Quintet, and that they also requested that the simulation segments be removed because players would not \"get\" them.Gameplay for ActRaiser 2 consists primarily with side-scrolling platform action, similar to the \"Professional!\"/\"Action\" mode from the original game. The player, assuming the role of \"the Master\" (still referred to as \"God\" in the Japanese version), controls a floating palace to inspect the people of the world below. After hearing their plight the Master descends to the world below to fight the monsters and rid the land of evil. Like the original, each area contains two \"acts\"; the first act of an area consists of monsters spawned from a lesser demon named after an unfavorable condition, while the second act consists of monsters spawned from the primary evil, named after one of the seven deadly sins, with heightened challenge and peril.The side-scrolling action for ActRaiser 2 is more advanced than its predecessor. Controlling the Master, who now has a full set of functional wings, the player must navigate through dungeons and avoid certain peril by jumping, flying, falling, and floating to platforms. Armed only with a sword, and a shield which can deflect some attacks, the Master becomes heavily dependent upon magic. Magic is executed by holding down the designated button to \"charge up\" and is then released, consuming a magic scroll which are limited when the Master enters an area. When released, the magic may take various form depending on which position the Master is in. This is different from the first ActRaiser in which the player had to select a particular magic before descending down to the world to fight monsters and was limited to only that magic for the duration of battle. In ActRaiser 2, each magic is designed for particular situations and some magic is more powerful than others. By increasing the difficulty level at the options screen, the time it takes to \"charge up\" magic is increased, adding more difficulty to the game. The game's difficulty is also increased in that monsters require much more damage to be destroyed.","title":"ActRaiser 2","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/45/ActRaiser_2_box_art.jpg/220px-ActRaiser_2_box_art.jpg","developer":"Quintet","genre":"Platform game"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Addams_Family_(video_game)","description":"The Addams Family is a platform game based on the 1991 movie of the same name released by Ocean Software in 1992.

Its title for the Super NES in the United States is The Adventures of Kid Kleets. It was re-released for the Atari Jaguar in 2000, the Game Boy Advance on September 30, 2002 and the PlayStation on December 13, 2003.The Amiga CD32 / 3DO version of the game begins when Soccer Kid is waiting for the World Cup to start. However, the alien pirate Scab is scanning for trophies to add to his collection and starts beaming up the World Cup using his spaceship. While he beams the trophy into space, he collides with a satellite, blowing the Cup into five pieces that fall in random places around the world. It is up to Soccer Kid to recover the pieces. The Cup pieces are located in England, Italy, Russia, Japan, and the USA.By pressing different buttons at the title screen, the player can change the colors of Soccer Kid's clothes. This way, the protagonist can be a fan of the player's favorite team. In addition, the player can perform various tricks with his soccer ball, either to jump higher or take out enemies. If the ball cannot be recovered naturally, the player can summon a new one to work with, at the cost of bonus points at the end of a stage. Enemies include animals, cyclists, sailors, and robots. Most levels consist of two stages that must be cleared, the exception being two levels which are just a single stage to get past. Each county has a different boss at the end of the final stage, such as an Opera Singer in Italy, with Scab being the final boss at the stadium. In order to get the cup pieces, the player has to find football cards in each stage, allowing them to access a bonus stage to acquire the missing piece.Reviewing the 3DO version, Allgame's Shawn Sackenheim wrote that Soccer Kid is \"an impressive action/platformer that manages to be just different enough to warrant investigation.\"[3]","title":"Soccer Kid","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/61/Soccer_Kid_Coverart.png","developer":"Krisalis","genre":"Platform"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mighty_Max_(TV_series)#Merchandise","description":"Mighty Max is an American animated action/sci-fi television series that aired from 1993 to 1994 to promote the British Mighty Max toys, an outgrowth of the Polly Pocket line, created by Bluebird Toys in 1992. It ran for two seasons, with a total of 40 episodes airing during the show's run.The series follows Max, an adventurous preteen boy who receives in the mail a small statue of a fowl, inscribed with Egyptian hieroglyphs whereof the translation states: \"You have been chosen to be the cap-bearer. Go to the mini-mart and wait for a sign, Mighty Max\". Shocked by the message, Max drops the statue, shattering it and revealing a red baseball cap emblazoned with a yellow \"M\", which he dons.Upon arriving at the mini-mart, Max is chased by a lava-monster sent by antagonist 'Skullmaster'. As Max flees, the cap teleports them to the Mongolian desert, where he befriends Virgil, a nearly omniscient Lemurian whose appearance is that of an anthropomorphic \"fowl\" (a running gag in the series is that Max refers to Virgil as a \"chicken\" to which the Lemurian replies \"Fowl, actually\"), who explains that Max's reception of the cap was prophesied c. 3000 B.C. Thereafter Max, Virgil, and Norman, his Viking bodyguard, travel together around the world, defending Earth against the minions of Skullmaster, who is responsible for the downfall of the Lemurians and the people of Atlantis. Norman is supposedly immortal and identified as or with Sir Lancelot, Thor, Samson, and Hercules. Most plot-driving episodes involve Skullmaster or one of his monstrous followers; but in many episodes, Max is required to stop an independent villain. While all episodes involve travel across Earth, one involves time travel, and the portal can even extend into the astral plane (as seen in the episode \"Souls of Talon\").While generally lighthearted and comical, the show's violence and descriptions of violent acts were considered excessive by some viewers. Many episodes began with a depiction of the story's principal monster killing a victim; whereas the series finale featured Max, Norman, and Virgil pitted against Skullmaster and their previously defeated foes. Both Norman and Virgil are killed, leaving Max to defeat Skullmaster. Unable to do so, Max uses the cap in order to time travel to the events of the first episode, creating a time paradox. At first, he experiences déjà vu; but after he reads Virgil's modified letter, he recalls everything, and decides to set it right in order to defeat the Skullmaster.Select episodes of the show were released on VHS in NTSC and PAL formats.In all episodes, a short ending scene preludes the credits, wherein Max is shown at his desk in his room, where he discusses with the audience some aspect of the episode in an educational way (similar to other children's cartoon series, including The Magic School Bus), usually the location where the events took place, the type of monster that was fought, etc. Occasionally, Max is shown in another setting such as a library or museum, or is simply heard recorded on an answering machine (such as \"Armageddon Outta Here\", the series finale); but these sequences were not broadcast on some channels, such as the British terrestrial airings on BBC1 (though included on the Nickelodeon airings). Generally, the educational messages at the end of each shows were of scientific, historical, or cultural significance (for example, the mythology of another culture; new astronomical theories of the time; the biology of a giant squid; or the fact that Native Americans were first believed to be Indians by European explorers).In addition to the epilogue, facts are unobtrusively given in show, often by Virgil's comment.The merchandising was far more popular than the show itself.[citation needed] Mighty Max toys were sold as play-sets of varying sizes with very small (usually non-articulated[14]) figurines inside. Each play-set contained a Mighty Max figure as well as one or more villains and sometimes Virgil, Norman, or both. There were a small series of larger, more expensive play-sets with various mechanical and electronic features such as opening jaws (on an island play-set shaped as a dragon's head) and lights. Almost all episodes of the TV series were based at least loosely on one of the Mighty Max play-sets.In 1994, due to the popularity of the play-sets at the time, the McDonald's Happy Meal offered a toy play-set featuring Mighty Max.[15]In February 1995, A video game, The Adventures of Mighty Max, was released for the SNES and Sega Genesis/Mega Drive[16] (which were packaged with a VHS copy of Day of the Cyclops and Let Sleeping Dragons Lie, respectively[citation needed]). A handheld game was also released from Tiger Electronics and Systema.[17]The show generated other merchandise such as a comic book (10 issues), a sticker album, at least one puzzle, and board games.[18] In some countries, replicas of Max's cap were sold,[19] although not all are necessarily officially licensed merchandise.","title":"","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/00/Mighty_Max_title_card.png/220px-Mighty_Max_title_card.png","developer":"","genre":""},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventures_of_Rocky_and_Bullwinkle_and_Friends_(video_game)","description":"The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle and Friends is a video game released by THQ inspired by The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show.","title":"The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle and Friends","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/17/Adventures_of_Rocky_and_Bullwinkle_NES_box_art.jpg/175px-Adventures_of_Rocky_and_Bullwinkle_NES_box_art.jpg","developer":"Imagineering","genre":"Platform"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoners_of_the_Sun_(video_game)","description":"Prisoners of the Sun is a video game based on The Seven Crystal Balls and Prisoners of the Sun from the series The Adventures of Tintin, the comics series by Belgian cartoonist Hergé.

The players then select a difficulty level, which affects the amount of passengers, world events (and the reactions of the passengers to those world events), and the win conditions.

The game offered a two-player mode that alternated between simultaneous and alternating play based on the event. There was also a tournament mode where up to 16 players (8 male and 8 females), could face off, with any missing slots filled in by computer players.The events from the previous game were joined by Atlasphere, and were always played in the following order: Assault, Human Cannonball, Atlasphere, Joust, Powerball, and The Wall.

It was the second fighting game franchise created by SNK, following the Fatal Fury series and is set in the same fictional universe as a prequel to the Fatal Fury series. The original Art of Fighting was released in 1992, followed by two sequels: Art of Fighting 2 (龍虎の拳2, Ryūko no Ken 2?) in 1994 and Art of Fighting 3: The Path of the Warrior (ART OF FIGHTING 龍虎の拳 外伝, Art of Fighting: Ryūko no Ken Gaiden?) in 1996.It was the first fighting game by SNK to feature the character designs of former illustrator Shinkiro, who would go on to do the character designs for the later Fatal Fury and The King of Fighters games.The Art of Fighting series follows the conventions of the time in the sense that the player faces a variety of opponents in best two-out-of-three matches. Each of the game's characters have a unique fighting style and set of special techniques. The player has two basic attacks—punch and kick—as well as a utility button that switches between punches, kicks, and throws. A fourth button is used for taunting. Art of Fighting's contribution to the genre was the inclusion of a \"spirit gauge\" underneath the character's life bar. When characters perform special techniques, their spirit gauge is depleted and their special attacks become weaker. Players can also drain their opponent's spirit gauge by taunting them.The Art of Fighting series was also the first fighting series to allow players to perform a \"super attack.\" In the original Art of Fighting, the player's character learns a super attack (dubbed the super death blow) by completing one of the game's bonus rounds (this technique is available by default in the 3rd game). All three games also feature \"Desperation Attacks\" that can only be performed when the player's health is low and the life bar is flashing red.The series also introduced graphical scaling into the genre: as the characters move towards each other, the camera zooms in to maximize the level of detail. Character sprites in Art of Fighting change as the fight progresses to become more bruised and cut as damage is taken.The games follow the struggles of the students of the Kyokugen Karate Dojo, Ryo Sakazaki and Robert Garcia, in what appears to be the late 1970s. Ryo is the son of the Kyokugen Karate discipline's creator, Takuma Sakazaki, and Robert is the wayward son of a billionaire family from Italy. The initial two titles are set in South Town, a common location in SNK games that is also the setting for the Fatal Fury series, while the third appears to take place in a fictitious area of Mexico.The plot of Art of Fighting alludes to Fatal Fury. Art of Fighting 2, for instance, documents the rise of Geese Howard, a character in Fatal Fury, from corrupt police commissioner to crime lord of Southtown. Takuma is said to be a contemporary of Jeff Bogard, adopted father of Fatal Fury's main heroes, Terry and Andy Bogard; Jeff Bogard's murder at the hands of Geese Howard triggers the events of the Fatal Fury series.The Art of Fighting series originally served as a prequel to the Fatal Fury series, taking place during the late 1970s and early 1980s. This is reflected by the characters' official birthdates in the series and given ages in each game. This is made even more obvious with the appearance of a young Geese Howard in Art of Fighting 2. The Hyper Neo-Geo 64 game Buriki One and the PlayStation port of Fatal Fury: Wild Ambition features an older modern-day Ryo adopting his father's former identity of Mr. Karate. While The King of Fighters series features characters from the Art of Fighting series and alludes to events occurring in the games, it follows a completely different continuity from that of the actual Art of Fighting and Fatal Fury games. This was done so that the Art of Fighting characters could fight alongside the Fatal Fury cast and other characters without aging them; however, continue to maintain the existing stories from the other games.In the first game, Ryo Sakazaki and Robert Garcia set out to find Ryo's sister, Yuri, who has been kidnapped by Mr. Big. Mr. Big has taken the girl to entice Takuma Sakazaki, Ryo's father and originator of the fictional form of karate known as Kyokugen Karate (\"Extreme style\"), and because Ryo refused to work for Big. After they defeat Mr. Big, Ryo and Robert face the enigmatic Mr. Karate. Art of Fighting's story ends with a cliff-hanger; Yuri is about to disclose the true identity of Mr. Karate as their father Takuma.Only Ryo and Robert are playable in the 1-player story mode although eight of the characters are playable in the 2-player vs. modes. Mr. Big and Mr. Karate can be played in the arcade version by reaching the final stage of the game then having a second player join in, and on the console versions via the use of cheat codes.Art of Fighting's events are referenced often in the wider SNK universe; The King of Fighters '97, for instance, parodies the events of the game in its ending.After winning a match while playing story mode, there are three bonus stages players can choose from:The objective is to cut off the tops of five bottles on a table. The player must carefully time and press the A button when a special bar fills to full for maximum power. Cutting all the bottles at once completes the stage, rewarding the player by increasing their spirit gauge for the rest of the game.Within a time limit, the player has to build up enough power to break five blocks of ice. Pressing the A button will fill a gauge on the screen. If successful, the player will be rewarded with an increased life bar for the rest of the game.The player must execute the super special move, Haoh Shoko Ken, a number of times to learn and use in game. The number of times needed to perform the move in the given time limit is dependent on the game's difficulty level. This is also the only bonus game that if it's successfully completed, it cannot be chosen again.Art of Fighting 2 was released in 1994. The second installment in the AoF series added the \"rage gauge\"; similar to the \"spirit system\" of its predecessor, it limited the use and effectiveness of special attacks.The game's story is set a year after the original. Geese Howard, a rising star in South Town's criminal underworld, calls fighters to the city for a new tournament, \"The King of Fighters.\" Howard was the final boss and series villain of SNK's other fighting game franchise Fatal Fury (though he is a secret boss in this game), whose story took place over a decade after the events of Art of Fighting.Art of Fighting 2 was the only time Yuri Sakazaki was a playable character in the series. It also marked the only time that she donned her trademark outfit, which was made famous in The King of Fighters series. This game also marks the debut of Takuma Sakazaki without his Mr. Karate persona, as well as Eiji Kisaragi, who both appear in the King of Fighters series. Ryuhaku Todo, the first boss in the original AOF, is the only character dropped; all characters are playable from the beginning. The final boss is always Mr. Big, though as mentioned earlier, an extra match will be played against Geese Howard if the player unlocks him through good performance.The game was praised by both GamePro and Electronic Gaming Monthly for having far better graphics, sound, character selection, and gameplay technique than the original Art of Fighting, though three of EGM's four reviewers complained that in single player mode the opponent AI is \"incredibly cheap\".[1][2]This time the bonus stages are reworked: instead of cutting bottles the player's character has to chop down one tree with one punch; for strength, many punks must be beaten at once. The Initiate Super Fire Blow stage is now adapted for each character's super special move.AOF2 was re-released for the Wii's Virtual Console in North America on 28 July 2008 at a cost of 900 Wii Points.[3]Art of Fighting 3 (Ryūko no Ken Gaiden, in Japanese: 龍虎の拳 外伝). featured a new cast of characters with the exception of Ryo and Robert. Yuri Sakazaki is seen in the game, but only as a side character in Ryo and Robert's story mode.The story switched focus from the Sakazakis to Robert Garcia. Garcia disappears to search for an old childhood friend, Freia Lawrence, and he tracks her to GlassHill, Mexico. Freia is wanted by the game's main antagonist, Wyler, to complete a powerful elixir that was created by his and Freia's fathers. The drug affects users in a similar manner as the potion in The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde.One of the game's characters, Kasumi Todoh, became a part of The King of Fighters cast. This game is the only one in the series to have a CD Drama Arranged Soundtrack.[4]It was re-released for the Wii's Virtual Console in North America on 21 March 2013 at a cost of 900 Wii Points.All three games were released for the MVS Arcade System, Neo Geo Home System, and Neo Geo CD with the first one being included on SNK Arcade Classics Vol. 1.The SNES version of the first game features an extended ending which ties to the sequel Art of Fighting 2, rather than ending the game on a cliffhanger like the original Neo Geo version does. Additionally, the English localisation of the port was censored. Many of the locations had their names changed (Mac's Bar was changed to Mac's Cafe), the No Smoking sign in Todo's stage was removed and the player can no longer expose King's bra without the use of a special or super move. The vehicle driving scenes have been omitted.The Neo Geo version of Art of Fighting was released for the Wii Virtual Console on October 2007 and Art of Fighting 2 was released on July 2008.The PlayStation 2 version of Art of Fighting stays true to the original Neo Geo cartridge. However, the vocals in the opening title have been stripped, as have Ryo's vocals.The Mega Drive/Genesis version lacks the zooming effect.[5] The gameplay has been changed as well, the Ryuuko Ranbu is blockable, Jack's drop kick only goes 2/3 of the screen, and Lee's claw spin has invincibility during the starting pose.Some of the Art of Fighting cast have continued appearing in other SNK fighting games (particularly in The King of Fighters) long after the last Art of Fighting game was produced. In the same way that Geese Howard appears as a hidden end boss in Art of Fighting 2, Ryo Sakazaki appears as a secret opponent in Fatal Fury Wild Ambition and Fatal Fury Special. Unlike the battle against Geese in Art of Fighting 2, the battle against Ryo is depicted as a \"dream match\" and does not occur in the series' storyline.As a result of these crossover appearances between the two franchises, SNK produced The King of Fighters series, pitting characters from both series against each other. As mentioned in the continuity section above, the series eschews the continuity of the Art of Fighting and Fatal Fury games for the purpose of having the Art of Fighting cast fight against everyone else without aging them. Ryo, Robert, and Yuri have appeared in nearly every installment along with King, Takuma, and Kasumi, who are constant characters as well. Eiji and Mr. Big also made appearances as playable characters in the series.The characters from the series have also appeared in the SNK vs. Capcom series and in NeoGeo Battle Coliseum. Capcom's Capcom vs. SNK: Millennium Fight 2000 features Ryo, Yuri, and King while Capcom vs. SNK 2 adds Ryuhaku Todoh to the lineup. SNK vs. Capcom: SVC Chaos features Ryo, Kasumi, and Takuma under his Mr. Karate guise. NeoGeo Battle Coliseum features Lee Pai Long, Mr. Big and an aged Robert Garcia along with the older Ryo Sakazaki from Buriki One. In The King of Fighters: Maximum Impact 2, Ryuhaku Todoh drives the truck in one of the extra games.The Street Fighter Alpha character Dan Hibiki is a parody of Ryo and Robert.A Japanese animated television movie, Art of Fighting (バトルスピリッツ 龍虎の拳, Battle Spirits Ryuuko no Ken?), was created and directed by Hiroshi Fukutomi and produced by NAS. It was the third animated co-production between SNK and NAS, following Fatal Fury: Legend of the Hungry Wolf and Fatal Fury 2: The New Battle. The designs of some characters were based on their appearances in the Japanese commercials for Art of Fighting 2. Although most of the cast from the original game is featured Lee Pai Long, Micky Rogers and Takuma Sakazaki do not appear. Yuri Sakazaki is voiced by Ayumi Hamasaki, before she established herself as a successful J-Pop singer.Art of Fighting was produced by Kenji Shimizu and Yoshiro Kataoka for Fuji TV on 23 December 1993. It features a script by Nobuaki Kishima, character design by Kazunori Iwakura, and was distributed in the English language by US Manga Corps in 1997.Art of Fighting has received negative reception by most American websites. It was billed as stupid, idiotic and plodding,[6] and compared to a Saturday morning cartoon.[7][8] It was said it had \"Choppy animation, illogical perspectives, uninspired art, badly choreographed fight scenes, and most of all horrible voice acting\",[6] and none of the interest of the video game or its sequels translate into the anime.[9] The film gathered a 14% rating at Meta Anime Rviews,[10] placing it in the bottom 3% of the reviewed titles.While searching for a cat, Ryo and Robert (two karate experts) witnessed a murder related to a stolen diamond. After fighting the murdering mobsters, they discovered that the top mobster, Mr. Big, had kidnapped Ryo's sister to exchange her against the diamond, which he believes to be in the possession of the protagonists. They then have to defend themselves anyway they can – mainly through kicks and punches. They both attempt to break into Big's hideout to save Yuri but their plans are foiled by the sudden arrival of the police force. Forced with no other options, they spend the night searching for the diamond. When they find it, they go to meet Big and give it to him. A big fight ensues, complete with an exploding helicopter and a bout with King and Big, but they are able to save Yuri and head back home. Todoh and the police force arrest Big and his men. They also confiscate the diamond, which is somewhere at the bottom of Big's pool.","title":"","developer":"SNK","genre":"Fighting"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterix_(1993_video_game)","description":"Astérix is a 1993 platform game for the Nintendo Entertainment System, Sega Master System, Super Nintendo Entertainment System and Game Boy.

(known in Japan as Space Funky B.O.B.) is a video game that was released in 1993. It is a side-scrolling game, a 2D shooter and a platform game.B.O.B. was developed by Gray Matter Inc. and Foley Hi-Tech Systems, and published by Electronic Arts for both the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and Sega Mega Drive/Genesis.The cover art for the EA packaging was illustrated by Marc Ericksen.In August 2006, GameSpot reported that Electronic Arts would be also porting B.O.B. to the PlayStation Portable as part of EA Replay. It was released in North America on November 7, 2006.[1]When B.O.B. crashes his dad's space car on the way to pick up his date, he finds himself stranded on a hostile asteroid filled with enemies. By collecting power ups and using fast reflexes, B.O.B. tries to find his way off the asteroid and to his date. B.O.B. fights his way through three strange worlds in total, encountering several particularly enormous or swift enemies (bosses) along the way, and participating in several cart-race levels. There were several different types of setting for each level, including domed space colony cities, large alien hive-type areas, strange biomechanical facilities, ancient (and apparently haunted) temples and cavernous magma chambers. Some of these settings only appeared on certain worlds.At the end of each world, B.O.B manages to discover a new space-car to allow him to continue on his journey. The first two both fail him under comical circumstances, resulting in him becoming trapped on an entirely new alien world. With the final car, B.O.B. is at last able to meet up with his date, who is revealed to be a large, blue female robot with a huge mouth, who harshly berates B.O.B. for his tardiness. As she is yelling at him, a slender red female robot flies past them on a space surfboard. B.O.B., frustrated with his obnoxious date, declares \"That's the girl for me!\" and drives off in pursuit of the red female. The game ends with a shot of B.O.B. and his new date sitting on a small asteroid together, staring out at the beauty of the cosmos in silence. Behind them, B.O.B.'s car (in the backseat of which his date had stashed her surfboard) stalls and drifts off in to space, presumably leaving them stranded together but neither of the lovers seem to notice.The player can choose from a wide variety of weapons and gadgets called \"remotes\", each with their own ammunition or stock. Use of remotes, such as a trampoline or helicopter, is necessary to complete some stages. A punch is also available when ammunition for B.O.B.'s gun runs out, or if the player wishes to conserve it. There is a time limit on every stage and once it runs out the player loses.B.O.B. uses the same game engine as the Wayne's World video game, also developed by Gray Matter. Elements of the shooting, jumping, and boss battles are very similar between the two games.","title":"B.O.B.","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/88/B.O.B._Coverart.png/220px-B.O.B._Coverart.png","developer":"Gray Matter Inc.","genre":"Run and gun"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballz","description":"Ballz is a two-player 3D action fighting game for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis, the Super NES (SNES) and the 3DO. It was developed by PF Magic and published by Accolade in 1994. The 3DO version was released as a director's cut in 1995. Ballz offered three difficulty levels over a total of 21 matches. Its distinguishing quality was that each of the characters were composed completely of balls, with a pseudo-3D look.The opening PF Magic developed for the game stated \"To be the champion, you gotta have Ballz!\". Due to its racy double-entendre (\"balls\" may be used as a slang term for testicles), Nintendo demanded the wording be changed for the SNES version. The SNES version of the game states \"...you gotta play Ballz\", while the Sega version uses the original intro. The game was also notably bizarre for its lineup of fighters, which included a farting monkey, a jumping clown, a sumo wrestler, a caveman, a bodybuilder, a ballerina, a rhinoceros and a \"superhero\".On release, Famicom Tsūshin scored the Super Famicom version of the game a 28 out of 40.[2] GamePro gave the Genesis version a positive review. They praised the balanced gameplay, smooth scaling effects, and humorous sound effects, and concluded, \"Ballz takes the increasingly routine genre of fighting games and gives it a new bounce, injecting a wicked sense of humor into the action.\"[3]Ballz was ranked seventh in a 2011 list of Top Ten Fighting Games We'd Like to Forget, compiled by Game Informer. The author of the list, Dan Ryckert, widely criticized it for including what he claimed to be \"sexual innuendo\" references, and having its design representing more of a 2-D look.[4]","title":"Ballz","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/56/Ballz.jpg/220px-Ballz.jpg","developer":"PF Magic","genre":"Fighting"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbie_Super_Model","description":"Barbie: Super Model is a one or two player multiplayer educational action video game that allows the player to play as Barbie.","title":"Barbie: Super Model","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/ba/Barbie_Super_Model_Coverart.png/220px-Barbie_Super_Model_Coverart.png","developer":"Tahoe Software Productions","genre":"Educational"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barkley_Shut_Up_and_Jam!","description":"","title":"[hide]","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b4/BJJ_front.jpg","developer":"Accolade","genre":"Sports"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bass_Masters_Classic","description":"Bass Masters Classic: Pro Edition is an enhanced version of the Bass Masters Classic fishing video game.

Because of GBA's fewer number of buttons, some actions were set to combinations of buttons. In 2013 the game was added to Battle.net as free download emulated through DOSBox.[3]Blackthorne is set on the planet Tuul, which has existed for centuries without human knowledge. All of this time, Tuul's people have been ruled over by a single shaman who \"was blessed with all knowledge\". Years before the game begins, Thoros, the latest ruler, finds it near impossible to choose between his two sons as the next ruler. Believing it will solve the dilemma, he leads them to the deserts and kills himself. His body becomes two stones, light and dark, and he gives one to each boy to rule their own kingdoms respectively. The people of the lightstone form the kingdom of Androth, and the people of the darkstone form Ka'dra'suul. But while Androth respects their stone, Ka'dra'suul reject theirs, and are eventually transformed into monsters by it. In this time, a ka'dra named Sarlac seizes power. He forms an army and leads them against Androth.The game focuses around protagonist Kyle Vlaros who is known as the Blackthorne, out for revenge on Sarlac and his minions. The gameplay involves large platforming sequences, in which Kyle can run and climb around the environment, find keys and items and progress to the end of each maze like level. Combat in Blackthorne takes the form of gunfights. Both Blackthorne and his enemies can press against walls to avoid incoming bullets.

Originally released in 1991 for the NEC PC-9801 and FM Towns, it was later ported to the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) and PC Engine CD-ROM² (TurboGrafx-CD) in 1994–1995, including an expanded re-release titled Brandish Renewal. The SNES version was published by Koei in Japan in 1994 and in North America in 1995.A complete remake of the original Brandish for the PlayStation Portable (PSP), featuring 3D graphics and titled Brandish: The Dark Revenant (ブランディッシュ～ダークレヴナント～?), was released in Nihon Falcom in Japan in 2009. An English version is to be released for the PSP by Xseed Games in North America in 2014.Brandish was the first title in Nihon Falcom's series of the same name. It was followed by three sequels: Brandish 2: The Planet Buster, Brandish 3: Spirit of Balcan, and Brandish VT (Brandish 4), that were originally released between 1991 and 1996.Brandish is a top-down view dungeon crawler game. The original version of the game was an early attempt at using fairly sophisticated mouse controls in a real-time overhead action role-playing video game, where the player can move the warrior character Ares (known as Varik in the original English version[2]) forward and backward, turn, strafe, and attack by clicking on boxes surrounding the player character. The player's objective is to escape from a labyrinth of over 40[3] floors filled various monsters, traps and puzzles.Brandish: The Dark Revenant turns the game's female antagonist Dela into an optional alternate player character. Since Dela is a magician, she plays differently from the protagonist Ares the warrior.[4] The game's \"Dela Mode\" is shorter (lasting about 10 hours as compared to some 20 hours with Ares) but harder than the main scenario.[3]Originally released by Nihon Falcom in 1991 for the NEC PC-9801 and FM Towns home computers (and also ported for MS-DOS exclusively in Korea by Mantra[2]), Brandish was later released for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) and PC Engine CD-ROM². The PC Engine version was published by NEC and features CD quality music as well as vocal dialogue and narration. The PC-98 version was re-released as Brandish Renewal in 1995, with some new music and hard drive support.The 3D remake titled Brandish: The Dark Revenant was developed and released by Nihon Falcom for the PlayStation Portable in 2009 only in Japan.[5] Its limited edition includes a calendar and original soundtrack CD. The Dark Revenant was given a budget price re-release in 2010.[6]Brandish Storybook (ブランディッシュ・ストーリーブック)　(ISBN 978-4944000142) is a novelization of the game, co-authored by Katsunori Inoue and Suzuki Noriyuki and published in 1992. The story is told from the perspectives of both Ares and Dela. Another novel, Brandish Ares: Yobisamasu Unmei (ブランディッシュ・アレス 呼び覚ます運命?) (ISBN 978-4893661463), is a prequel for the game, originally published in 1993. It was later made available for free (in Japanese) at Falcom's official website.[13]Several soundtracks with the music from the game were also released, including Perfect Collection Brandish (KICA1102) and Falcom Neo Classic (KICA1114-5) in 1992, Falcom Special Box '93 (KICA9012-5) and Falcom Ending Collection 1987-1992 (KICA1132-3) in 1993, Brandish Piano Collection (KICA1153) in 1994, Falcom Special Box '96 (KICA9026-28) in 1996, Falcom Classics (KICA1201) in 1997, and Brandish ~The Dark Revenant~ Original Sound Track (NW10102800) and Brandish Original Sound Track ～FM TOWNS & Renewal～ (BR-OST-FR) in 2009.[14]1995's audio drama CD Drama Brandish Gaiden (CDドラマ ブランディッシュ外伝) features voice acting by Yasunori Matsumoto (Ares), Kikuko Inoue (Dela), Junko Iwao, Yūko Mizutani, Kyōko Hikami, Yūko Miyamura, Minoru Inaba, Ryōtarō Okiayu, Yuri Amano, Kaori, Jūrōta Kosugi and Masako Katsuki (the cast is different from in the game's PC Engine CD-ROM² version). The drama was released as a part of Falcom Special Box '96 and Falcom Special Box '97 (KICA9029-31).The SNES version of Brandish was not very well known or popular in the West because of its late release, when the SNES market was beginning to fade off in anticipation of the Sega Saturn and PlayStation. Furthermore, it was published by Koei, which was known at the time for their strategy wargames and not role-playing or action games. Nevertheless, the SNES game received mostly positive reviews in North American video game magazines. GamePro review stated that \"despite some shortcomings, Brandish has a fine story to play.\"[16] VideoGames gave it a score of 7/10, commenting that with its relatively weak graphics, Brandish \"goes for a solid gameplay over flash.\"[17] In 2003, a retrospective review by Marc Golding of HonestGamers awarded the SNES Brandish four stars out of five, recommending it for fans of the genre.[18] Slime of RPGFan reluctantly gave it an overall score of 75%.[19]The game proved popular enough in Japan to warrant two direct sequels exclusively in Japan that continued the adventures of Ares and Dela. The first one was Brandish 2: The Planet Buster (ブランディッシュ2 THE PLANET BUSTER), originally released for the PC-98 in 1993 and ported to the Super Famicom (SNES) in 1995[20] (like Falcom's later Ys V, the game was released in \"normal\" and \"expert\" difficulty versions).[2] The next sequel was Brandish 3: Spirit of Balcan (ブランディッシュ3 SPIRIT OF BALCAN), originally released for the PC-98 in 1994.[21] None of these were officially released in English, but Brandish 2 received a fan translation in 2009.[22]Brandish 3 was followed by Brandish VT, originally released in 1996, and renamed Brandish 4: The Tower of Sleeping God (ブランディッシュ4 眠れる神の塔) when it was re-released for Windows in 1998. This final game follows a similar gameplay format, now with isometric graphics, but with completely different storyline and characters.[21] Dela also makes and appearance in Falcom's 2010 Ys vs. Sora no Kiseki: Alternative Saga as a support character.[23]","title":"Brandish","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/ee/Brandish_Coverart.png","developer":"Nihon Falcom","genre":"Action role-playing game"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brawl_Brothers","description":"Brawl Brothers, known in Japan as Rushing Beat Run (ラッシング・ビート乱　複製都市, Rasshingu Bīto Ran: Fukusei Toshi?, \"Rushing Beat Chaos: The City of Clones\"),[1] is a side-scrolling beat 'em up game made by Jaleco in 1992 for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System.

Initially released in Japan in April 1993, the game was later made available in North America in August 1994 by Square Soft, who handled the title's English localization and promotion.Recognized by Capcom as their first traditional role-playing video game, Breath of Fire would set the precedent for future entries in the series, and features character designs by company head of development Keiji Inafune, as well as music by members of Capcom's in-house sound team Alph Lyla. In 2001, the game was re-released for the Game Boy Advance handheld system with new save features and minor graphical enhancements, with the English version being released in Europe for the first time.Set in a fantasy world, Breath of Fire follows the journey of a boy named Ryu, one of the last surviving members of an ancient race with the ability to transform into mighty dragons, as he searches the world for his sister. During his quest, Ryu meets other warriors who share his quest, and comes into conflict with the Dark Dragon Clan, a militaristic empire who seeks to take over the world by reviving a mad goddess. The game experienced mostly positive reception upon release, and was followed by a direct sequel, Breath of Fire II, in 1994.Breath of Fire is a traditional role-playing video game, featuring two-dimensional character sprites and environments presented from a top-down perspective.[1] Players move their characters in four directions while navigating through a number of environments ranging from towns to dungeons filled with traps and monsters. In order to advance the story, the player must take part in story-based scenarios that require them to enter dangerous areas and defeat enemies while also interacting with non-player characters to become involved in the plot.[2]Players advance the game by doing battle with enemy creatures. Combat in Breath of Fire takes place in hostile areas such as dungeons, with encounters occurring randomly every few steps.[5] The game uses a turn-based system while in combat, where the player inputs commands for each character at the start of each round, which are then carried out by order of their \"agility\" rating. While each controllable character's health is indicated by numerical hit points, an enemy's vitality is represented by a colored bar that decreases as they take damage, and must be reduced to nothing in order to be defeated.[6] Stronger boss characters have the ability to continue battle even after their health bar is depleted, with their true remaining health being obscured for the rest of the battle. Characters can cast spells to harm enemies or aid their allies, which require AP (Ability Points) in order to be cast. When a player defeats all enemies present, they are awarded with experience points that go towards leveling up characters, making them stronger and giving them access to new spells.[6] Progress is saved in one of three slots using the game cartridge's internal battery back-up, which can be accessed by dragon statues at certain points throughout the game.[4]Breath of Fire features a cast of characters originally designed by Keiji Inafune, also known for his work on the Mega Man series, with official artwork by Tatsuya Yoshikawa. Each character hails from a different clan made up of anthropomorphic animal-like beings or humans with fantastic powers, with their assortment of magic spells and personal field abilities that can be used out of battle to help the player progress through the game and find hidden items.[5]Breath of Fire takes place in an unnamed medieval world. In addition to ordinary humans, it is populated by various \"clans\" of anthropomorphic animals. The Dragon Clan—a race of humans who are able to transform into dragons—differ from the others in that their members appear (for the most part) to be human. The back-story of the game is summarized during its prologue: Thousands of years ago, a goddess named Myria (also known as \"Tyr\" and \"Maria\" in some English translations) sowed discord amongst the Dragon Clan by offering to grant any wish. Feuding over the goddess' favor eventually split the Clan into two feuding sides, the Light Dragons and the Dark Dragons, who engaged in a war. Myria encouraged the fighting and watched the war escalate. Just as the world was on the brink of destruction, the \"Goddess War\" ended when a heroic Light Dragon imprisoned Myria and sealed her away using six keys.[9] Each key has a unique magical property which affects the surrounding landscape; the Light Key is hidden in the port town of Auria, providing boundless prosperity for its residents. Alternatively, the Dark Key resides near the slums of Bleak, accounting for that town's perpetual darkness.Breath of Fire was developed by Capcom for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System by designer Yoshinori Kawano (credited as Botunori) and producer Tokuro Fujiwara, previously known as the creator of the Ghosts 'n Goblins series. Keiji Inafune, Capcom's head of development, designed the game's characters. However, Inafune's supervisor took him off the project and replaced him with Tatsuya Yoshikawa. The latter artist respectfully kept many of Inafune's design features in the new illustrations.[11] Inafune was also credited in the staff credits, as Inafking. Capcom added easter eggs into the game in the form of cameo appearances by characters from other company franchises, including Chun-Li from Street Fighter.[12] The game's English release in August 1994 was a joint effort between Capcom USA and Square Soft, who handled most of the title's localization and promotion in North America due to Capcom's lack of experience with text-heavy role-playing games.[13] Square Soft would feature the game in the fourth issue of its North American newsletter, The Ogopogo Examiner, and would advertise the game as being \"from the makers of the Final Fantasy series.\"[14] Breath of Fire's English localization was handled primarily by Ted Woolsey, whose previous works included Final Fantasy Legend III, Final Fantasy Mystic Quest, and Secret of Mana.[15] Because of space limitations in game's text fields, many items, as well as character and spell names had to be truncated in order to fit, resulting in numerous abbreviations.[5]In March 2001, Capcom Japan announced that Breath of Fire would be ported to Nintendo's Game Boy Advance handheld system with new features and a more \"intuitive\" gameplay system.[16] The new version includes re-drawn character portraits, as well as a re-designed menu system that resembles Breath of Fire II, along with updated cutscene graphics at certain points during gameplay.[17] Additionally, Capcom added the ability for players to temporarily save their progress at any point using a new \"quick save\" feature, as well as a new dash button that allows for faster movement through the game.[5] Using the Game Boy Advance link cable, two players may also exchange items between game cartridges using a new trade feature.[17] Two months before the 2001 Electronic Entertainment Expo in Los Angeles, Capcom USA announced that they would be publishing an English version of the game initially for release the following September.[18]The music for Breath of Fire was composed by four members of Capcom's sound team Alph Lyla: Yasuaki Fujita, Mari Yamaguchi, Minae Fuji, and Yoko Shimomura, originally credited under the pseudonyms \"Bun Bun\", \"Mari\", \"Ojarin\", and \"Pii♪\", respectively. Although no official soundtrack for the game was made available during its original release, the background themes from the title would later be included on the Breath of Fire Original Soundtrack Special Box released in March 2006, which featured music from the first five games of the series.[19] To help promote the title, Capcom used the song \"Running Wild\" by Toshi and rock band the Night Hawks in the game's television commercial in Japan, with a re-recorded version featuring slightly different lyrics called \"Breath of Fire\" later appearing on the Night Hawks' June 1994 album The Midnight Hawks.[20]Breath of Fire met with \"considerable success\" during its original release in Japan,[13] and was mostly well received by critics during its release in North America in 1994. Critics such as Nintendo Power praised its level of exploration and found it to be \"not as linear as other RPGs such as Final Fantasy II\", but that its plot was relatively standard and contained \"more fighting than adventure fans might like.\"[27] GamePro similarly felt that the game's story was \"nondescript and average\" and that Capcom \"should have tried for more interesting enemies, different battle screens, or butt-kicking graphics\", finding the overall experience to be \"bland\".[25] Others, such as Game Informer, found the game to be highly above-average, awarding it a 9 out of 10 score,[23] while Electronic Gaming Monthly praised the title's \"excellent graphics and sound\", ultimately stating that \"Even if you're not a fan of these kinds of more deliberately-paced games, you'll still get hooked on this one!\"[21] While the title was only \"modestly successful\" in North America,[33] Nintendo Power noted a spike in sales following the release of the game's sequel in December 1995, calling it \"a rare second wind.\"[34] The Super Nintendo version maintains a 78% average score on aggregate review website GameRankings.[30] In 1997, Breath of Fire was ranked 82nd in Nintendo Power's list of the top 100 games released on Nintendo consoles,[35] and in 2006, it placed 161st in the magazine's top 200.[36]Play Magazine called the game's port job from the Super Nintendo console \"flawed in execution\", commenting on handheld version's high color saturation and lower sound quality.[29] GameSpot felt that the game was overall a faithful translation of the original, but that the music sounded \"tinny\" when compared to its predecessor, also stating that \"While it's not the best-looking or most technically impressive RPG out for the system, Breath of Fire is still a rock-solid game.\"[1] IGN would also comment on the game's presentation, declaring that it was \"not much more than your typical Japanese-style RPG\" and that its graphics were outdone by titles developed specifically for the system, additionally lauding its high random encounter rate and simplistic puzzles, ultimately calling Breath of Fire \"a decent diversion\".[5] Electronic Gaming Monthly took note of the conversion's shortcomings, but praised its new save feature that allowed players to stop the game at any time, declaring that \"Overall, BoF exemplifies hand-held role-playing done right.\"[22] Other publications such as Game Informer recommended the game to anyone who \"likes RPGs\",[24] along with Nintendo Power who referred to it as an \"excellent epic that still holds up\".[28] GamePro found the title to be \"an enjoyable RPG that easily kills spare time\" but that it was overall less involving than later games in the series, calling its narrative \"lifeless\".[26] In 2002, Breath of Fire became runner-up for \"Best Game Boy Advance Role-Playing Game\" in IGN's Best of 2001 awards.[38]Breath of Fire influenced two officially licensed manga which were first serialized in Japanese magazines. The first, Breath of Fire: Ryū no Senshi by Hiroshi Yakumo, is a re-telling of the events of the video game which was first published in Family Computer Magazine before being released as a two-volume collection by Tokuma Shoten. The manga embellishes on certain parts of the plot while omitting others entirely, and introduces new characters such as Bo's son Dele. The second, Breath of Fire: Tsubasa no Oujo (ブレス オブ ファイア -翼の王女-, lit. Breath of Fire: Princess of the Wings) by Kouji Hayato, takes place after the events of the game and focuses on the relationship between Ryu and Nina, and first appeared in Monthly Shōnen Jump before also being released in a two-volume compilation by Shueisha Jump Comics. Hayato followed up the manga with a side-story called Breath of Fire Part II: Chiisana Boukensha (ブレスオブファイア PART2 ~小さな冒険者~, lit. Breath of Fire Part 2: Little Adventurers), which featured the adventures of Ryu and Bo's sons, which was later released as its own single volume.","title":"Breath of Fire","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/cf/Breath_of_Fire_cover.jpg/256px-Breath_of_Fire_cover.jpg","developer":"Capcom","genre":"Role-playing video game"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breath_of_Fire_II","description":"Breath of Fire II (Japanese: ブレス オブ ファイアII 使命の子, Hepburn: Buresu obu Faia Tsū: Shimei no Ko?, Breath of Fire II: The Destined Child) is a role-playing video game developed and published by Capcom. First released in 1994, the game was licensed to Laguna for European release in 1996. It is the second entry in the Breath of Fire series. It was later ported to Game Boy Advance and re-released worldwide. The game has been rated by the ESRB for release on Wii's Virtual Console and was released in North America on August 27, 2007. Nintendo of Europe's website mistakenly announced it for release on July 27, 2007, but it was in fact released two weeks later, on August 10, 2007.Unlike later installments in the series, Breath of Fire II is a direct sequel to Breath of Fire. Set 500 years after the original game,[1] the story centers on an orphan named Ryu Bateson, whose family vanished mysteriously long ago. After his friend is falsely accused of a crime, Ryu embarks on a journey to clear his name.Breath of Fire II is a traditional role-playing video game featuring two-dimensional character sprites and environments.[2] Players view the game from a top-down perspective and move their characters in four directions across various environments including towns and dungeons while interacting with non-player characters and battling enemies to advance the story.The game features a redesigned, text-based game menu as opposed to the icon-based design of the original Breath of Fire, as well as a new \"Monster Meter\" that indicates the probability of encountering enemy monsters in a given area.[3] Players are required to venture into dangerous areas throughout the game world as dictated by the story, and randomly encounter enemies every few steps which must be defeated to advance. As the game progresses, new characters, each with their own specific abilities, join the player's party. Like the previous game, only four characters may be in a party at a given time, but now may not be freely switched outside of certain areas. Each character has a unique Personal Action that may be performed outside of combat that allows the player to access certain areas, destroy objects, avoid traps, or move about the game more easily.[4] Breath of Fire II includes a new town-building feature that allows the player to populate their own village with special characters found throughout the game.[5] Each character has their own distinct job, and may be invited to live in houses that the player adds by donating currency to one of three carpenters, each with their own building style. Six special inhabitants known as Shamans may also join the town, each with their own elemental alignment, and up to two at a time may be fused with party members to grant them new forms and abilities. While joined with a shaman, characters become stronger and may gain access to additional abilities while in battle.[5]Combat in Breath of Fire II is presented using a turn-based approach, where the player inputs commands for each character at the start of each round with the actions taking place by order of each character's and enemy's \"agility\" rating.[6] A new Formation feature allows the player to organize their party into different positions, allowing certain members an increase in speed, defense, or attack power. Players win battles by defeating every enemy present, dealing damage by using normal attacks along with magic spells and items. When all enemies are defeated, they yield experience points that go toward leveling up characters, making them stronger and giving them access to new spells.[6] Each Characters' health is represented by numerical hit points that indicate their remaining vitality, and are knocked out if the value reaches zero, with the battle ending if each member of a player's party is knocked out. Progress is recorded using the game cartridge's internal battery back-up memory, which can be accessed at dragon statues throughout gameplay.[7]The characters of Breath of Fire II were designed by Capcom artist Tatsuya Yoshikawa, who also provided artwork for the cast of the previous game. Breath of Fire II features nine playable characters who join the player's party at set points throughout the story, each with their own selection of attacks, magic spells, and personal actions which can be used to pass certain obstacles and solve puzzles.[4]Breath of Fire II is set in a fantasy world 500 years after the events of the original game.[1] The story opens on Ryu, age 6, who lives in a village with his sister Yua and father Ganer, a priest for the Church of St. Eva. Years earlier, Ryu's mother was killed by demons who attacked the village from a hole in a mountain on the outskirts of town, which was eventually blocked by a large dragon who sacrificed its life to stop the invasion. One day after visiting the lifeless dragon near the mountainside, Ryu returns to find his family missing and no one in the village remembers who he is, thinking him an orphan and sending him to live at the church with Father Hulk, who has apparently been acting pastor for years. It is there that he meets Bow, a fellow orphan who convinces Ryu to run away with him to a big city and live as thieves. Upon leaving the village, the two seek shelter in a cave during a storm, where they encounter an enormous demon named Barubary who claims that Ryu is the \"Destined Child\", knocks the two unconscious, and disappears.[10]Breath of Fire II was developed by many of the same Capcom employees who worked on the previous game, including producer Tokuro Fujiwara and lead designer Yoshinori Kawano. While the character designs for the original Breath of Fire were conceived by company head of development Keiji Inafune, the cast of Breath of Fire II was created entirely by artist Taksuya Yoshikawa, who had previously only provided promotional art for the game's predecessor. Unlike the original Breath of Fire, which was licensed to Square Soft for its North American release, the English version of Breath of Fire II was localized and published entirely by Capcom USA. The game was released in North America one year after the Japanese version in December 1995, and would later become the first Breath of Fire title to become available in Europe in April 1996.Three days before the release of the original Breath of Fire on Nintendo's Game Boy Advance in July 2001, Capcom announced that they would similarly port Breath of Fire II to the handheld, with an initial release date some time in 2002.[14] Like the re-release of its predecessor, the handheld version features re-drawn character portraits in menu screens, new still images used in cutscenes throughout the game, and a re-designed battle interface similar to Breath of Fire IV.[15] New features include a dash button that allows players to move through the game faster,[16] as well as an item-sharing system where two players may link together using the Game Boy Advance link cable to exchange items between game cartridges.[1] To celebrate of the game's release in December 2001, Capcom of Japan held an art contest for fans to submit artwork featuring characters from the first two Breath of Fire games, with the winner chosen by the Game Boy Advance version's staff.[17] In January 2002, Capcom USA announced that an English version of Breath of Fire II would be heading to North America the following April.[18] A European version would also be released in July 2002, published by Ubisoft.While the background music for the original Breath of Fire was composed by four members of Capcom's sound team Alph Lyla, the score for Breath of Fire II was written entirely by series newcomer Yuko Takehara.[19] In January 1995, the Breath of Fire II: Shimei no Ko Original Soundtrack was released in Japan by Sony Records, and featured 28 selected themes from the game on a single disc.[19] A complete musical selection from the title would not be made commercially available until 2006, with the release of the Breath of Fire Original Soundtrack Special Box, which contained all music from the first five games of the series.[20] In order to promote the game, Capcom hired J-pop singer Mio Watanabe to record a theme song that played during the game's television commercial in Japan called \"Owaranai Ai\" (終わらない愛, lit. Unending Love), which was released as a single in December 1994 by Alfa Records.[21]Breath of Fire II was released the same week as Sony's PlayStation console in Japan, and debuted on Japanese software charts as the seventh highest-selling game of its first week with 89,700 copies.[38] It was given an 8 out of 10 in two separate Reader Cross Reviews printed by Famicom Tsūshin,[39][40] and it would go on to sell a total of 350,000 copies in the region by the end of 1995.[41] The game became popular enough to be re-released in the region for the Nintendo Power flash RAM peripheral in September 1997 at a reduced price.The game's reception in North America was generally positive. In 2006, Nintendo Power would rank the game 171st in its list of the top 200 games released across all Nintendo consoles, exactly ten places behind the original Breath of Fire.[42] Breath of Fire II maintains a 79% average score on aggregate review website GameRankings.[35]Similar to the original Super Nintendo Entertainment System release, the Game Boy Advance version met with mostly positive reception from critics, with the Japanese version receiving a 29 out of 40 score from Weekly Famitsu magazine.[25] GameSpot compared the game to the previous version, calling it a \"faithful translation of the SNES game\" and praised the title's new save feature allowing players to record their progress at any time, but found that its music \"leans toward the bland side of things\" and \"lack[s] personality\".[16] IGN found the game to be a step up from the first game's Game Boy Advance port, stating that \"The storyline and characters make Breath of Fire II a much better game than the first adventure in the series...even though the game hasn't changed a whole lot.\" The website additionally felt that the game's lack of spaces in text fields and shoddy translation hurt the overall presentation, and the graphics were not up to par with games designed initially for the handheld such as Camelot's Golden Sun.[15] GamePro Magazine awarded the Game Boy version a perfect score as well as an Editor's Choice Award, stating that the only flaw was the game's low difficulty, declaring that \"In the realm of today’s high-powered next-gen role-players, BOFII is an excellent time-killer\".[29] The game would later be nominated for \"Best Port of a 16-bit Classic\" and \"Best Role-Playing Game on Game Boy Advance\" in GameSpot's Best and Worst of 2002 Awards.[43][44] The Game Boy Advance version holds a 75% review average on GameRankings,[36] as well as an 81% average on Metacritic.[37]Breath of Fire II '​s Virtual Console release in 2007 met with mixed response. GameSpot called attention to the title's \"pleasing visual presentation\" and breadth of content, but found the game's localization to be \"terrible\" along with unpolished gameplay mechanics that made it appear to be a \"hasty, careless effort\". The game's pacing was also said to be poor, with too many \"mundane tasks\" laden throughout the story, recommending it to players who could look past its \"rough edges\".[2] IGN called the game's translation \"average at best\" with the lack of adequate spacing in text fields still present, yet ultimately calling it a \"solid, enjoyable RPG experience...though not a role-playing masterpiece on the level of Final Fantasy VI or Chrono Trigger\".[31] Eurogamer called attention to the game's high rate of random battles, but nonetheless called the game \"a beautifully crafted and impeccably produced adventure\".[24]","title":"Breath of Fire II","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/ba/Breathoffire2_box.jpg/256px-Breathoffire2_box.jpg","developer":"Capcom","genre":"Role-playing video game"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brett_Hull_Hockey","description":"Brett Hull Hockey is an ice hockey video game for Super Nintendo Entertainment System in addition to the Atari Jaguar, Sega Genesis and MS-DOS compatible personal computers developed in 1994 by Accolade Inc. and Ringler Studios.","title":"Brett Hull Hockey","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/05/BrettHullHockeyUSBoxShotSNES.jpg/256px-BrettHullHockeyUSBoxShotSNES.jpg","developer":"Radical Entertainment","genre":"Traditional ice hockey"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brett_Hull_Hockey_%2795","description":"","title":"Brett Hull Hockey '95","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/90/BrettHullHockey95BoxShotSNES.jpg/220px-BrettHullHockey95BoxShotSNES.jpg","developer":"Radical Entertainment","genre":"Traditional ice hockey"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronkie_the_Bronchiasaurus","description":"Bronkie the Bronchiasaurus, also known as Bronkie Health Hero, is an educational Super Nintendo Entertainment System platform video game published by Raya Systems. that takes place in a prehistoric city.

It is based on Taito's popular 1986 arcade game Bubble Bobble, featuring characters and themes from that game. Its characteristically \"cute\" Japanese animation and music, along with its play mechanics and level designs, made it successful as an arcade title and spawned several sequels and ports to home gaming systems.Two different versions of the original game were released. Puzzle Bobble was originally released in Japan only in June 1994 by Taito Corporation, running on Taito's B System hardware (with the preliminary title \"Bubble Buster\"). Then, 6 months later in December, the international Neo Geo version of Puzzle Bobble was released. It was almost identical aside from being in stereo and having some different sound effects and translated text.As with many popular arcade games, experienced players (who can complete the game relatively easily) become much more interested in the secondary challenge of obtaining a high score (which involves a lot more skill and strategy). Puzzle Bobble caters to this interest very well, featuring an exponential scoring system which allows extremely high scores to be achieved.The two dinosaurs operating the pointer are called Bub and Bob (or Bubblun and Bobblun in Japan). Their graphics and animation are based directly on the original Bubble Bobble, only larger (very similar to Bubble Symphony which was released less than a month later). Less obvious is the fact that Puzzle Bobble also features all the enemies from Bubble Bobble, which are trapped inside the bubbles and fly out when the bubbles pop. Inspecting the bubbles closely, one can see the enemies twitching inside the bubbles.Many popular clones of Puzzle Bobble have been produced, including:","title":"Puzzle Bobble","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f6/Puzzbob.jpg/250px-Puzzbob.jpg","developer":"Taito Corporation","genre":"Puzzle"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cacoma_Knight_in_Bizyland","description":"Cacoma Knight in Bizyland, known in Japan as Cacoma Knight (カコマ☆ナイト, Kakoma Naito?) is a Super NES video game created by Datam Polystar.

Only two games in the series were created by Sensible, but were converted to most active systems at the time of release. The series has a clear, somewhat darkly humorous method of gameplay that perhaps even doubles as social commentary. A sequel, Cannon Fodder 2, was released in 1994 for Amiga and DOS. A third game, Cannon Fodder 3, was made by a Russian developer and released in English in 2012.The player is in charge of a squad of between one to eight men that can be, for command purposes, split up to three groups (referred to as Snake, Eagle and Panther squads). All men have a machine gun with unlimited ammunition, as well as limited caches of grenades and rockets that can be found on the map. In later levels, the player is provided with some grenades and rockets at the start of the mission. The player's machine guns do not harm its own soldiers, but friendly fire from grenades and rockets is possible, which are also the only weapons capable of destroying buildings and vehicles. Men can also die if hit by debris flung from exploding buildings and vehicles, get caught in man-traps, mired in quicksand, and hit by enemy fire. Men usually walk, but several vehicles are available in some missions.The games are split into several missions, which are usually sub-divided into phases. Dead soldiers are replaced by new ones at the start of each phase. Each soldier that survives a mission is promoted and receives a small increase in the rate of fire, accuracy, and range. The player is only able to save the game upon completion of a whole mission. Each phase is structured around mission objectives which range from \"Kill all enemies\" or \"Destroy enemy buildings\" to \"Rescue all hostages\". Some phases are complex, and require the player to use their imagination, pre-planning and strategy. For example players may have to split their team into two or more groups and leave one group to defend an area or route, assigning its control to the game's artificial intelligence, while taking control of another group.The pre-mission screen shows a hill with a grave for each dead soldier, with recruits lining up in front of it and a sports-like score at the top of the screen. Soldiers each have unique names, while on the grand scale of things being nothing more than interchangeable cannon fodder. The game has hundreds of individually named recruits, of which the first few — Jools, Jops, Stoo and Rj — were named directly after the development staff. As each recruit is killed in battle, he receives a tombstone on the hill and the next recruit in line takes his place.Cannon Fodder 2 introduced a variety of new settings: a Middle Eastern conflict, an alien planet and spaceraft, the medieval and gangster-themed Chicago. It nevertheless retained the same mechanics and gameplay. In the new settings, troops wielding grenades and rockets were replaced by such units as aliens and wizards, but nonetheless behaved in the same manner, as did battering rams representing trucks and so forth. The game was more difficult than its predecessor, employing puzzle elements such as multiple ways -of varying effectiveness- to solve levels. It featured reduced use of water obstacles but retained mines and booby traps.Cannon Fodder 3 featured a military, counter-terrorism theme with more advanced weather settings. It retained grenades and rockets as the central secondary weapons and introduced further power-ups. It expanded the selection of vehicles and added further enemy installations such as sniper towers. It also features an online cooperative mode.The theme tune (\"War Has Never Been So Much Fun\") for the game was written by the lead game designer Jon Hare, with musician Richard Joseph. Vocals were sung by Hare himself. A little-seen music video of the song was put together to promote the original release.Shot over just one day and for a total budget of £500, it featured the entire team dressed up in military uniforms, an assortment of masks (including one of Mario) and toy guns. The version of the music track is more complete than the one that appeared on the 16-bit versions and was recorded professionally. In fact, the menu screen track is also a pared down version of a proper song, featuring studio-standard vocals. Both of these tracks were written and performed by Jon Hare, as were many of the other songs featured in Sensible's games.Cannon Fodder began following successful strategy game Mega Lo Mania. Sensible Software to create another strategy game mouse control and the notion of sending troops on missions, but with more action than had been used in Mega Lo Mania. Production began in 1991 but slowed due to Mega Drive conversions of other games. Cannon Fodder lost its provisional publisher in the aftermath of owner Robert Maxwell's death. As work resumed on development, the team gradually reduced the complexity the strategy gameplay in favour of more direct control and action gameplay. In May 1993, Sensible Software found a new publisher in Virgin Interactive, which released the game in November.[1]Amiga magazines received the game positively, widely awarding scores of over 90%, while Amiga Action awarded an unprecedented score, calling it the best game of the year.[2] Critics praised the fun, addictiveness, music and humour of the game. The game also drew criticism in the Daily Star for its juxtaposition of war and humour and its use of iconography closely resembling the remembrance poppy.[3]Game Boy Color - Once Sensible Software was sold off to Codemasters, the decision was taken to port the game over to the Game Boy Color. The limit on having two men in your squad and a much smaller playing area meant changes had to be made to the gameplay, mainly to make it easier. Jon Hare described the change as converting \"11-a-side football to 5-a-side football\".[citation needed]Mobile phone - In 2004, Jon Hare set up a small mobile phone games team known as Tower Studios. Their first release was Sensible Soccer in 2004, followed by Cannon Fodder in 2005. Both titles were published by Kuju Entertainment. The games were only playable on certain color models and due to many keypads' inability to register a diagonal movement the control systems for both games had to be radically redesigned.[citation needed]In 1994, a free minigame called Cannon Soccer (or Cannon Fodder - Amiga Format Christmas Special) was included on the coverdisk of the Amiga Format Christmas issue. It was essentially two bonus levels of Cannon Fodder in which the soldiers fought hordes of Sensible Soccer players in a snowy landscape. The levels were titled \"Land of Hope and Glory\", and \"It's Snow Time\".One of the demos on the Amiga Power cover disk 21 was Sensible Soccer Meets Bulldog Blighty. It featured a mode of play that involved replacing players with soldiers from Cannon Fodder, and the ball with a hand grenade. The grenade would randomly begin to flash and would eventually explode after a few minutes, killing any nearby players. The magazine described it as a \"1944 version of Sensible Soccer\",[4] though The Daily Telegraph compared it to the Christmas-time football match in 1914.[5]Cannon Fodder 2 is a 1995 sequel featuring very similar gameplay and graphics to the point where an Amiga Computing review suggested it had more in common with a data disk than a true sequel.[6] The game featured levels set in deserts and an Alien spaceship as well as levels with a medieval theme. Amiga Computing rated the game at 71%.[6]The designer Stuart Campbell wrote, \"CF2 was a cross-cultural kinda game. Levels were inspired by films, music, other games, politics and events. Titles came from songs, books, and all manner of other sources.\"[7]After selling Sensible Software to Codemasters, Jon Hare ended up consulting on many of their development projects, one of which was the PS2 title Prince Naseem Boxing. Work on this title was performed in a satellite studio based in Hammersmith, London. However due to the commercial failure of this title, the studio was shut down. A casualty of this was cancellation of a 3D remake of Cannon Fodder, something that Hare had been working on for at least nine months. Hare did speak about how he was looking to expand on the whole theme of war and include gameplay not just set on the battlefield: \"I'd like to focus on the public's perceptions of war and warfare. There's many interesting things that go on behind the scenes with politicians\".[citation needed]In an interview with Eurogamer in late 2005, Hare confirmed that there was up to two years' work (on and off) put into a 3D update of Cannon Fodder: \"I designed Cannon Fodder 3 with Codies six years ago, development stopped and started three times and eventually it was seemingly permanently halted when the London studio was closed four years ago. Nothing would please me more than to see this project resurrected, it was very advanced in its structure and therefore would need little modernisation.\"[8]On August 28, 2006, Codemasters London announced that a brand new version of Cannon Fodder would appear exclusively for the PlayStation Portable. The game would have retained its familiar top down view, and the big heads of the soldiers, and for the first time the game would have been 3D. After a large launch announcement which included character renders and screenshots, the game was quietly canceled without explanation.[9] In a later interview, Hare said \"Unfortunately, through no fault of their own, Codemasters hit economic problems and had to sell the studio, so everything just went.\"[10]In 2008,[11] now intellectual property owner Codemasters licensed Russian publisher Game Factory Interactive to develop another sequel. GFI created the game along with developer Burut CT and released it in Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States in December 2011. English-language media speculated on whether GFI was permitted to release the game outside of that region, but Codemasters ultimately clarified it had reserved but declined the option of publishing the game.[12] GFI released the game in Europe and North America in February 2012 via a download service. The game retains the core style of its predecessors but with more advanced graphics, a counter-terrorism theme and a greater array of weapons and units. English-language publications gave the game mixed, mediocre reviews,[13][14][15] with both more positive,[16] and negative reviews appearing elsewhere in Europe.[17]","title":"","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/1d/Cannon_Fodder_series_logo.png","developer":"","genre":""},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capcom%27s_MVP_Football","description":"","title":"Capcom's MVP Football","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Capcoms_mvp_snes.jpg/220px-Capcoms_mvp_snes.jpg","developer":"Equilibrium","genre":"Traditional football"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capcom%27s_Soccer_Shootout","description":"J.League Excite Stage (Japanese: Jリーグエキサイトステージ?) is a series of Japan-exclusive soccer video games developed by A-Max and published by Epoch.The series was based on the J.League, and started with J.League Excite Stage '94. After two more titles for the Super Famicom, which were extremely successful, the series was later ported to the Game Boy Color and PlayStation, but without causing impact.The gameplay progresses in a side view, similar to an arcade soccer game. There are different formations to choose from, and all the players (except the goalkeeper) can be positioned anywhere in the field. Up to four players (SNES Multitap required) can compete in a series of games that include Exhibition, Full J.League Season, and All-Star Game modes. There are also Penalty Kick, Indoor Soccer (also known as Saloon football), and Training modes. The game boasts a realistic style including bicycle kicks, side tackles, diving saves along with several other moves. Players can strategize to be either neutral, on the offensive, or on the defensive. A complete board game map with all the players as dots appear on the top of the screen. All the players' names are in Japanese. Own goals are treated differently than normal goals and are given their own cutscene.The two sequels provided few improvements over their predecessor. Unlike in the first title, the goalkeepers can be either automatic or manual. In J.League Excite Stage '95, the penalty shoot-out was modified, switching to a split screen view. The most significant innovation of J.League Excite Stage '96 was the inclusion of beach soccer. This last title is still very popular these days and it is often considered to be one of the best and most complete soccer games of all-time, not in terms of realism, but gameplay and fun.Between 1997 and 2002, A-Max developed other series of soccer games entitled Dynamite Soccer, and it is possible to verify few similarities with Super Famicom's J.League Excite Stage. These games were released for the PlayStation, except J-League Dynamite Soccer 64.The following is a list of games released in the J.League Excite Stage series. The first game of the series were published by Capcom in North America as Capcom's Soccer Shootout and by Nintendo in Europe as Soccer Shootout. Instead of featuring all clubs from the 1994 J. League season like the original Japanese version, both versions featured 12 national teams.The game creator Ryōji Amano (天野亮司) was in charge of the development of the 94 and 95 titles.","title":"","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a1/Excitestage94.jpg/220px-Excitestage94.jpg","developer":"","genre":""},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_America_and_The_Avengers","description":"Captain America and the Avengers (キャプテンアメリカアンドジアベンジャーズ, Kyaputen Amerika ando ji Abenjāzu?) is an arcade game developed and released by Data East in 1991.

It was the seventeenth title produced for the company's CP System hardware. The game stars the titular superhero who was originally conceived as a fictional spokesman used by Capcom USA in the company's console games during the late 1980s.Captain Commando is set in the crime-ridden future of Metro City in the year 2026, where a superhero named Captain Commando, assisted by his three faithful Commando Companions rise up to protect the Earth and all the Galaxy from a gang of super-powered criminals.Captain Commando follows the same gameplay established in Capcom's previous beat-'em-up Final Fight. The arcade version allows up to two, three, or even four players simultaneously depending on the game's settings. The player can select between any of the four \"commandos\" (Mack, Captain, Ginzu, or Baby-Head) as their character, with each player controlling a different character. The player's objective as usual is to move towards the end of each stage, defeat every adversary who gets in their way while avoiding any traps that they may throw at the player's way before eventually fighting the boss awaiting at the final area of each stage. The game consists of a total of nine stages.The origin of Captain Commando as a character predates his appearance in his self-titled game. In the packaging and manuals of many of Capcom's earlier titles for the Nintendo Entertainment System in North America released between 1986 and 1989. All of Capcom's games released for the NES between 1986 and 1988 (1942, Commando, Ghosts 'n Goblins, Mega Man, Trojan, Section Z and Gun Smoke) were released as part of the \"Captain Commando Challenge Series\" and featured a drawing of the Captain on the back of the packaging, which depicted him as a \"futuristic\" space hero wielding a raygun on each hand and two large medallions around his neck with the letter \"C\" engraved on each. Each game's instruction manual also featured a \"Special Message\" from the Captain addressed to the owner of the game, congratulating the player for purchasing one of Capcom's products. Additionally the instruction manual for Section Z identified the otherwise nameless player character as being Captain Commando himself.A revised version of the Captain Commando character appeared again in Capcom's NES lineup in 1989 (Strider, Mega Man 2, Willow, and Duck Tales). The artwork on the rear packaging of those games featured an illustration of Captain Commando wearing a pilot suit in front of a fighter jet, holding a helmet under his right arm, with an alien chimp sitting on his right shoulder and the Capcom logo in the style of one of the Data East logos above them. The text above the artwork featured a message from the Captain advising the reader to \"look to (him) for up-to-date reports for all the exciting action games from Capcom\", followed by the Captain's apparent handwritten signature.Captain Commando would return as a player character in the fighting game Marvel vs. Capcom in 1998, as one of the characters representing Capcom. The Captain has a transformation sequence prior to each match which depicts him in a suit (or in a cowboy outfit) before donning his superhero costume. His \"Commando Strike\" special move, as well as both of his Hyper Combos (the \"Captain Sword\" and the \"Captain Storm\"), has him summoning his \"Commando Companions\" to attack his opponent. The Captain's victory quotes consist of random Capcom trivia, while his ending in Marvel vs. Capcom is a homage to the ending in his original game. This incarnation of Captain Commando also appears in the sequel, Marvel vs. Capcom 2. Besides the Marvel vs. Capcom games, Captain Commando also appears in three other cross-overs: Capcom World 2, Namco × Capcom, and the SNK vs. Capcom: Card Fighters Clash series. Captain Commando is part of Mangas based on Video games Gamest Comics.","title":"Captain Commando","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c7/Captain_Commando.png/250px-Captain_Commando.png","developer":"Capcom","genre":"Beat 'em up"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_Novolin","description":"Captain Novolin is a Super NES video game released by Raya Systems starring the eponymous superhero who has type 1 diabetes.[2] The game became available to the public in 1992 and was sponsored by Novo Nordisk, makers of the Novolin brand of insulin.[2] The game is part of a series of educational games from Raya that included Rex Ronan: Experimental Surgeon, Packy and Marlon and Bronkie the Bronchiasaurus.Captain Novolin is the only one who can stop such evil aliens as Blubberman and rescue the diabetic mayor of Pineville who was kidnapped by evil aliens. Throughout the game, Captain Novolin needs to avoid the alien invaders who have the appearance of junk food items such as bouncing cookies and doughnuts while eating healthy meals to keep his blood glucose within a safe zone. Captain Novolin can die if his blood glucose level goes too high or low. Players can earn bonus points by correctly answering questions that relate to diabetes. In addition, the game has a feature whereby a diabetic player can specify the frequency of their real-life insulin injections.[2][3]Richard M. Satava mentioned an evaluation of the Captain Novolin game that involved the interviewing of 23 diabetic children (10 boys and 13 girls in the age range of 6 to 16 years) and the parent of one child on an individual basis.[4] Boys and girls were enthusiastic about the game, and several children said that the game would be useful when telling their friends about diabetes.[5] The game was met with approval from all of the parents in the evaluation and was considered to have value for facilitating discussions with children about diabetes.[5] Barbara M. Hayes and William Aspray mentioned an evaluation of the Captain Novolin game that involved a number of diabetic children in the age range of 8 to 14 years, along with the parents of the children.[6] Participants said that the game could help parents and children to talk about diabetes, along with children talking to their friends about the subject.[6]","title":"Captain Novolin","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/30/Captain_Novolin_Coverart.png/220px-Captain_Novolin_Coverart.png","developer":"Sculptured Software","genre":"Action"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier_Aces","description":"Carrier Aces (キャリアエース?, \"Carrier Aces\") is a flight simulation game that was released in 1995 for the North American, European, and Japanese markets.","title":"Carrier Aces","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/af/CarrierAcesUSBoxShotSNES.jpg/220px-CarrierAcesUSBoxShotSNES.jpg","developer":"Synergistic Software, Inc.","genre":"World War II"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casper_(video_game)","description":"There have been different versions of video games based on the film Casper. Two of those games were released in 1996 and 1997 for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, one different from each other, by different publishers, and released in different regions. There is also another version for the 3DO, Sega Saturn, PlayStation, and Game Boy Color, published by Interplay Entertainment, as well as a Game Boy game.Casper is a game developed by Absolute Entertainment and published by Natsume.[4] The player controls Casper, followed by Kat Harvey whom he has to protect from any danger. Being a ghost, Casper can pass through walls and other obstacles, but he can't go away from Kat too much, or else Carrigan's ghost will abduct her. The game follows loosely the plot of the movie. This game uses a revised Absolute A Boy and His Blob engine. Picking up special objects allows Casper to morph into these objects to clear rooms of enemies, and to protect Kat from certain hazards. Mirrors placed throughout the game allows Casper and Kat travel to other parts of mansion, and outside electrical lines allow Casper to pick up the last of the toys, when he picks up the electric bolt morph.A different game, this time developed by Natsume, was released only in Japan by the anime company KSS. In this version, the game uses an isometric view and the player controls Kat Harvey herself as she protects Casper from a duo that consists of a male government agent and a female government agent. During the course of the game, Kat collects items, therefore making this game an adventure game as opposed to an action game.The version published by Interplay plays as a top-view action-adventure game with pre-rendered graphics. The game consists of three acts, first finding tokens of friendship for Kat and Dr. Harvey, then finding the pieces for the Lazarus machine (which Casper's uncles had disassembled under the impression he would use it on himself), and finally finding the Cellular Integrator (which Carrigan's ghost steals, leading Casper to her lair) while exploring the mansion and dealing with the Ghostly Trio. Unlike other versions, other than the Ghostly Trio and Carrigan (who serves as this version's final boss), there are no enemies. The game instead focuses on solving puzzles.Sega Saturn Magazine gave the Saturn version a 70%, calling it \"a decent enough effort with what is a particularly sugary film, spoilt by some frustrating flaws in the gameplay and action that is too repetitive.\"[5] Their next issue printed a retraction, admitting that Interplay had not sent them a review copy of Casper, and that the review was actually based on an unfinished version of the game.[6]","title":"Casper","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/31/Casper_Coverart.png/220px-Casper_Coverart.png","developer":"Absolute Entertainment","genre":"Action"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castlevania:_Dracula_X","description":"Castlevania: Rondo of Blood (悪魔城ドラキュラX 血の輪廻 (ロンド), Akumajou Dracula X: Chi no Rondo?, lit.

Developed by Sensible Software and first released for Amiga and Atari ST computers in 1992 as well as for the PC, it featured a zoomed-out bird's-eye view (most games until then such as Kick Off and Matchday used a closer top-down or side view), editable national, club and custom teams and gameplay utilising a relatively simple and user-friendly control scheme. One of the defining gameplay elements was the aftertouch feature, which enabled effective but unrealistic swerves.[1] The game topped charts such as Amiga Power's \"All Time Top 100\". The graphic style of the game was used in other Sensible Software games, such as Mega Lo Mania, Cannon Fodder and Sensible Golf.Sensible World of Soccer, commonly referred to as SWOS, was released in 1994. The game was almost published by Virgin Games, but they insisted on it being called Virgin Soccer.[2] It became a first in video games when it attempted to encompass the entire professional footballing world into one game. Featuring many divisions in many countries around the globe, it featured a twenty season career mode which allowed players to manage and play as thousands of different clubs from across the globe, many of which were very obscure.On November 1, 2005, it was announced in an interview at gaming website Eurogamer that the series would make a return in the Summer of 2006, with a full 3D title to be released on PC, PlayStation 2 and Xbox.[3] Codemasters, the holders of the licence, would release the game across all PAL territories, with the design capabilities overseen by Jon Hare, the original designer of the game. On June 9, 2006, it was released in Europe. No North American release is planned at this time.On September 27, 2006, Codemasters announced a new version of Sensible World of Soccer, developed by Kuju Sheffield, for the Xbox 360 to be released in summer 2007 on Xbox Live Arcade. It features both the classic \"retro\" visuals of the original SWOS, as well as new improved high definition graphics, and retains the exact gameplay of the 96/97 version of Sensible World of Soccer.[4] Due to problems with the game's network performance, the release was delayed in order for \"significant proportions\" of the network code to be rewritten.[5] After missing several previous release dates, the game appeared on Xbox Live Arcade on December 19, 2007[6] but was quickly pulled. A statement from Microsoft confirmed that an incorrect version of the game had been made available, in which online play was not possible.[7] The fixed version of the game was released two days later on December 21. The Windows version is still yet to be given a release date.From the time of its release, Mega placed the game at #1 in their Top 50 Mega Drive Games of All Time.[8] The Mega CD version of the game was #2 in their Top 10 Mega CD Games of All Time in the same issue.

It is the best-selling chess franchise in history, with more than five million units sold as of 2002[update].[2]The Chessmaster chess engine is called The King, written by Johan de Koning of the Netherlands. It was introduced in Chessmaster 4000; earlier releases featured a chess engine written by David Kittinger.According to the September 2009 Swedish Chess Computer Association (SSDF) rating list, Chessmaster 9000 has an estimated Elo rating of 2718 on an Athlon-1200 PC.[8] If multiple versions of other engines are stripped out of their list, Chessmaster 9000 ranks 14th among all engines tested. As of May 2008[update], Chessmaster 9000 remains the most recent version rated by the SSDF. Another rating list, CCRL, places Chessmaster 11th Edition in 24th place on its December 2009 list.[9]The King engine allows users to create new playing styles, also called \"personalities\", by manipulating several dozen different settings, such as King Safety, Pawn Weakness, Randomness, Mobility and others. Individual piece values can also be adjusted. Chessmaster 9000, for example, features over 150 different personalities ranging from International Grandmaster strength down to Stanley, who is described as a monkey and plays what are essentially random moves.The personality feature has inspired many amateur computer chess enthusiasts to attempt to find more optimum personalities. In Chessmaster 10th Edition, the creation of new personalities has been made easier than before.Chessmaster won the four-game match against Christiansen held in September 2002, by a score of 2½-1½.[10] The Chessmaster program was operated by John Merlino, the Project Manager of Chessmaster at the time of the match. Four different personalities were used in the match, the first three of which were based on famous human Grandmasters: Alexander Alekhine, Bobby Fischer, and Mikhail Botvinnik. The final game of the match used the default \"Chessmaster\" personality. Christiansen won the first game, lost the second and third games, and the fourth game resulted in a draw.To date, various versions of Chessmaster have appeared on Amiga, Apple II, Apple IIGS, Atari 8-bit, Atari ST, Amstrad CPC, ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, DOS, PC, Macintosh, Nintendo Entertainment System, Super Nintendo Entertainment System, Game Boy, Game Boy Color, Game Boy Advance, Nintendo DS, Sega Genesis (as a Sega Channel exclusive), Sega Game Gear, PlayStation, PlayStation 2, Xbox, and mobile phones.[11] Early Macintosh versions Chessmaster 3000 and 4000 were developed by Sebastian Rapport and Troy Heere that leveraged the Kittinger and de Koning engines respectively.[citation needed] Later Macintosh versions were ported by Feral Interactive, and the latest Macintosh version available is Chessmaster 9000. Ubisoft also offers a downloadable version of the game, Chessmaster Challenge, which differs from Chessmaster 10th Edition in its simplified interface and scaled-down tutorials.[12]The more recent editions of Chessmaster include both 2D and 3D designs, and a large number of different boards and themed chess piece designs. The interface was revised for Chessmaster 10th Edition and features animated 3D sets in which the pieces \"walk\" between squares and have simulated battles when a piece is taken, reminiscent of Battle Chess or the Wizard's chess set from Harry Potter. Chessmaster 10th Edition also comes packed with a pair of red and blue glasses to view the set in \"enhanced 3D\".An Xbox Live Arcade version with Xbox Live multiplayer and Xbox Live Vision camera support for the Xbox 360 called Chessmaster Live was released on 30 January 2008, but is no longer available.This version of Chessmaster contained a bug allowing the white player to indefinitely hold up a match until a player resigned. The game was eventually patched so that neither player would gain or lose Elo points if they resign before the first move.Compute! stated that Chessmaster 2000 \"is now the yardstick for which other similar programs will be measured\", and favorably cited Software Toolworks' decision to give all versions of the game the same sophisticated engine.[13] Computer Gaming World in 1986 wrote of the IBM PC version, \"I wish I could find something negative to include in this review but I can't ... It gets my absolute highest recommendation\". It noted that the game had a sophisticated defense, but would resign in hopeless situations without forcing the human to finish an inevitable win.[4] The magazine also favorably reviewed the Amiga version, calling the graphics \"exceptional\" and concluding \"highly recommended\".[14] Chessmaster 2000 became the first and only chess game to be the top-rated game in Computer Gaming World '​s reader poll,[15] and with a score of 7.25 out of 10, in 1988 it was among the first members of the magazine's Hall of Fame, honoring those games rated highly over time by readers.[16] In 1989 the magazine found Chessmaster 2100 '​s features \"the clear winners\" over Sargon 4,[17] and in 1992 reported that Chessmaster 3000 had added \"a lot\" to its predecessors, with new tutorial features and a variety of computer opponents making the game \"a truly impressive sequel\".[18]Critical reaction to the Chessmaster series has been mostly positive. GameSpot commented that \"Chessmaster has remained the consummate standard in console chess games since the '80s.\"[21] IGN said that \"the series itself remains the best way to play and learn about chess on the PC.\"[22]Chessmaster: Grandmaster Edition, the most recent PC edition of the series, scored positive reviews, with PC Gamer saying: \"this one-stop shop for an entire chess-playing and learning family should last until you're all grandmasters.\"[23] Chessmaster 10th Edition holds an 84% rating on review aggregator site Game Rankings.[24] IGN gave Chessmaster 10th Edition a score of 8.4/10, calling it \"the best chess game in town.\"[22] GameSpot's review of Chessmaster 10th Edition said, \"If you're looking for a good chess program that's packed with a plethora of features and all the bells and whistles, you'll be very happy with Chessmaster 10th Edition.[25]The mobile phone version of Chessmaster received a score of 9/10 from IGN, who called it \"an absolutely superlative product that will be enjoyed for week after week by fans of the mental contest.\"[26] IGN criticized the Nintendo DS version of Chessmaster: The Art of Learning for its lack of multiplayer, but gave it an overall positive review, with a score of 7.8/10.[27] IGN criticized the \"boring\" presentation of the PlayStation Portable version of Chessmaster: The Art of Learning, but added that \"there's no doubt that the information is valuable and can teach you the finer points of the game.\"[28]Although the Chessmaster engine is generally not as strong as the engines of other commercially-available chess programs such as Fritz,[29][30] critics have praised the Chessmaster series for its comprehensive tutorials aimed at players of amateur and moderate skill levels. In its review of Chessmaster 9000, IGN said that \"the series has always distinguished itself with first-rate chess teaching tools,\" and welcomed the game's \"appeal towards inexperienced and mid-level players. With all manner of tutorials, detailed analysis and exercises, the game helps ease newbies into the experience.\"[31] GameSpot's review of Chessmaster 10th Edition commented positively on the game's \"huge bundle of features aimed at everyone from the neophyte who's looking to learn the basics to the advanced wood pusher who may need practice for tournament play.\"[25]A common criticism of the series has been the lack of new features in successive installments. IGN's review of Chessmaster 10th Edition commented, \"it simply doesn't add enough over any of the last two versions to make it a necessary upgrade.\"[22]","title":"Chessmaster","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/75/Chessmaster.jpg/200px-Chessmaster.jpg","developer":"Ubisoft Romania","genre":"Chess"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chester_Cheetah:_Too_Cool_to_Fool","description":"Chester Cheetah: Too Cool to Fool is a 1992 video game that starred Cheetos mascot Chester Cheetah, only released in North America.","title":"Chester Cheetah: Too Cool to Fool","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/ce/Chester_Cheetah_-_Too_Cool_to_Fool_Coverart.png/220px-Chester_Cheetah_-_Too_Cool_to_Fool_Coverart.png","developer":"System Vision","genre":"2D action"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chester_Cheetah:_Wild_Wild_Quest","description":"Chester Cheetah: Wild Wild Quest is a 1993 video game that starred Cheetos mascot Chester Cheetah.

Chrono Trigger '​s development team included three designers that Square dubbed the \"Dream Team\": Hironobu Sakaguchi, the creator of Square's Final Fantasy series; Yuji Horii, a freelance designer and creator of Enix's popular Dragon Quest series; and Akira Toriyama, a freelance manga artist famed for his work with Dragon Quest and Dragon Ball. Kazuhiko Aoki produced the game,[6] Masato Kato wrote most of the plot, while composer Yasunori Mitsuda scored most of the game before falling ill and deferring remaining tracks to Final Fantasy composer Nobuo Uematsu.[4][7] The game's story follows a group of adventurers who travel through time to prevent a global catastrophe.Square re-released a ported version by Tose in Japan for Sony's PlayStation in 1999, later repackaged with a Final Fantasy IV port as Final Fantasy Chronicles in 2001 for the North American market. A slightly enhanced Chrono Trigger was released for the Nintendo DS on November 25, 2008, in North America and Japan, and went on sale in Australia on February 3, 2009 and in Europe on February 6, 2009.[8] The game was never released in PAL territories before the Nintendo DS version.Chrono Trigger was a critical and commercial success upon release and is frequently cited as one of the best video games of all time. Nintendo Power magazine described aspects of Chrono Trigger as revolutionary, including its multiple endings, plot-related sidequests focusing on character development, unique battle system, and detailed graphics.[9] Chrono Trigger was the third best-selling game of 1995, and the game's SNES and PlayStation iterations have shipped 2.65 million copies as of March 2003.[10][11] The version for the Nintendo DS sold 790,000 copies as of March 2009.[12] Chrono Trigger was also ported to mobile phones,[13] Virtual Console,[14] the PlayStation Network,[15] iOS devices,[16] and Android devices.[17]Chrono Trigger features standard role-playing video game gameplay with several innovations. The player controls the protagonist and his companions in the game's two-dimensional fictional world, consisting of various forests, cities, and dungeons. Navigation occurs via an overworld map, depicting the landscape from a scaled down overhead view. Areas such as forests, cities, and similar places are depicted as more realistic scaled down maps, in which players can converse with locals to procure items and services, solve puzzles and challenges, or encounter enemies. Chrono Trigger '​s gameplay deviates from that of traditional RPGs in that, rather than appearing in random encounters, many enemies are openly visible on field maps or lie in wait to ambush the party. Contact with enemies on a field map initiates a battle that occurs directly on the map rather than on a separate battle screen.[18]Players and enemies may use physical or magical attacks to wound targets during battle, and players may use items to heal or protect themselves. Each character and enemy has a certain number of hit points; successful attacks reduce that character's hit points, which can be restored with potions and spells. When a playable character loses all hit points, he or she faints; if all the player's characters fall in battle, the game ends and must be restored from a previously saved chapter, except in specific storyline-related battles that allow or force the player to lose. Between battles, the player can equip his/her characters with weapons, armor, helmets, and accessories that provide special effects (such as increased attack power or defense against magic), and various consumable items can be used both in and out of battles. Items and equipment can be purchased in shops or found on field maps, often in treasure chests. By exploring new areas and fighting enemies, players progress through Chrono Trigger '​s story.Chrono Trigger uses an Active Time Battle system—a staple of Square's Final Fantasy game series designed by Hiroyuki Ito for Final Fantasy IV—named \"Active Time Battle 2.0.\"[19] Each character can take action in battle once a personal timer dependent on the character's speed statistic counts to zero. Magic and special physical techniques are handled through a system called \"Techs.\" Techs deplete a character's magic points (a numerical meter like hit points), and often have special areas of effect; some spells damage huddled monsters, while others can harm enemies spread in a line. Enemies often change positions during battle, creating opportunities for tactical Tech use. A unique feature of Chrono Trigger's Tech system is that numerous cooperative techniques exist.[18] Each character receives eight personal Techs which can be used in conjunction with others' to create Double and Triple Techs for greater effect. For instance, Crono's sword-spinning Cyclone Tech can be combined with Lucca's Flame Toss to create Flame Whirl. When characters with compatible Techs have enough magic points available to perform their techniques, the game automatically displays the combo as an option.Chrono Trigger features several other unique gameplay traits, including time travel. Players have access to seven eras of the game world's history, and past actions affect future events. Throughout history, players find new allies, complete side quests, and search for keynote villains. Time travel is accomplished via portals and pillars of light called \"time gates\", as well as a time machine named Epoch. The game contains thirteen unique endings; the ending the player receives depends on when and how he or she reaches and completes the game's final battle.[20] Chrono Trigger DS features a new ending that can be accessed from the End of Time upon completion of the final extra dungeon and optional final boss.[3] Chrono Trigger also introduces a New Game+ option; after completing the game, the player may begin a new game with the same character levels, techniques, and equipment, excluding money, with which he or she ended the previous play through. However, certain items central to the storyline are removed and must be found again, such as the sword Masamune. Square has since employed the New Game+ concept in later titles, including Chrono Cross, Parasite Eve, Vagrant Story and Final Fantasy X-2.Chrono Trigger takes place in a world similar to Earth, with eras such as the prehistoric age, in which primitive humans and dinosaurs share the earth; the Middle Ages, replete with knights, monsters, and magic; and the post-apocalyptic future, where destitute humans and sentient robots struggle to survive. The characters frequently travel through time to obtain allies, gather equipment, and learn information to help them in their quest. The party also gains access to the End of Time (represented as year ∞), which serves as a hub to travel back to other time periods. The party eventually acquires a time-machine vehicle known as the Wings of Time, nicknamed the Epoch. The vehicle is capable of time travel between any time period without first having to travel to the End of Time.Chrono Trigger's seven playable characters come from different eras of history. Chrono Trigger begins in AD 1000 with Crono, Marle and Lucca. Crono is the silent protagonist, characterized as a fearless young man who wields a katana in battle. Marle (Princess Nadia) lives in Guardia Castle; though sheltered, at heart she's a princess who enjoys hiding her royal identity. Lucca is a friend of Crono's and a mechanical genius; her home is filled with laboratory equipment and machinery. From the era of AD 2300 comes Robo, or Prometheus (designation R-66Y), a robot with near-human personality created to assist humans. Lying dormant in the future, Robo is found and repaired by Lucca, and joins the group out of gratitude.[21] The fiercely confident Ayla dwells in 65,000,000 BC. Unmatched in raw strength, Ayla is the chief of Ioka Village and leads her people in war against a species of humanoid reptiles known as Reptites.Crono's friends awake in a village and find Magus, who confesses that he used to be prince Janus of Zeal.[26] In his memories, it is revealed that the disaster at the Ocean Palace scattered the Gurus of Zeal across time and sent him to the Middle Ages. Janus took the alias of Magus and gained a cult of followers while plotting to summon and kill Lavos in revenge for the death of his sister, Schala, but when Lavos appeared after his battle with Crono and his allies he was cast back to the time of Zeal and presented himself to them as a prophet. As Crono's friends depart, the Ocean Palace rises into the air as the Black Omen. The group turns to Gaspar for help, and he gives them a \"Chrono Trigger,\" an egg-shaped device that allows the group to replace Crono just before the moment of death with a Dopple Doll. Crono and his friends then gather power by helping people across time with Gaspar's instructions.[27] Their journeys involve defeating the remnants of the Mystics,[28] stopping Robo's maniacal AI creator,[29] addressing Frog's feelings towards Cyrus,[30] locating and charging up the mythical Sun Stone, retrieving the Rainbow Shell, and helping restore a forest destroyed by a desert monster.[31] The group enters the Black Omen and defeats Queen Zeal, then successfully battles Lavos, saving the future of their world.Chrono Trigger DS added two new scenarios to the game.[3] In the first, Crono and his friends can help a \"lost sanctum\" of Reptites, who reward powerful items and armor. The second scenario adds ties to Trigger's sequel, Chrono Cross.[3] In a New Game +, the group can explore several temporal distortions to combat shadow versions of Crono, Marle, and Lucca, and to fight Dalton, who promises in defeat to raise an army in the town of Porre to destroy the Kingdom of Guardia.[33] The group can then fight the Dream Devourer, a prototypical form of the Time Devourer—a fusion of Schala and Lavos seen in Chrono Cross. A version of Magus pleads with Schala to resist; though she recognizes him as her brother, she refuses to be helped and sends him away. Schala subsequently erases his memories and Magus awakens in a forest, determined to find what he had lost.[34]Chrono Trigger was conceived in 1992 by Hironobu Sakaguchi, producer and creator of the Final Fantasy series; Yuji Horii, director and creator of the Dragon Quest series; and Akira Toriyama, famous manga artist and creator of the Dragon Ball series.[2] Traveling to America to research computer graphics, the three decided to create something that \"no one had done before.\"[2] After spending over a year considering the difficulties of developing a new game, they received a call from Kazuhiko Aoki, who offered to produce.[2] The four met and spent four days brainstorming ideas for the game.[2] Square convened 50-60 developers, including scenario writer Masato Kato, whom Square designated story planner.[3] Development started in early 1993.[35] An uncredited Square employee suggested that the team develop a time travel-themed game, which Kato initially opposed, fearing repetitive, dull gameplay.[3] Kato and Horii then met several hours per day during the first year of development to write the game's plot.[3] Square intended to license the work under the Seiken Densetsu franchise and gave it the working title of \"Maru Island\"; Hiromichi Tanaka (the future director of Chrono Cross) monitored Toriyama's early designs.[36] The team hoped to release it on Nintendo's planned Super Famicom Disk Drive; when Nintendo canceled the project, Square reoriented the game for release on a Super Famicom cartridge and rebranded it as Chrono Trigger.[36] Tanaka credited the ROM catridge platform for enabling seamless transition to battles on the field map.[36]Aoki ultimately produced Chrono Trigger, while director credits were attributed to Akihiko Matsui, Yoshinori Kitase and Takashi Tokita. Toriyama designed the game's aesthetic, including characters, monsters, vehicles, and the look of each era.[2] Masato Kato also contributed character ideas and designs.[3] Kato planned to feature Gaspar as a playable character and Toriyama sketched him, but he was cut early in development.[37] The development staff studied the drawings of Toriyama to approximate his style.[38] Sakaguchi and Horii supervised; Sakaguchi was responsible for the game's overall system and contributed several monster ideas.[2][38] Other notable designers include Tetsuya Takahashi, the graphic director, and Yasuyuki Honne, Tetsuya Nomura, and Yusuke Naora, who worked as field graphic artists.[39] Yasuhika Kamata programmed graphics, and cited Ridley Scott's visual work in the film Alien as an inspiration for the game's lighting.[40] Kamata made the game's luminosity and color choice lay between that of Secret of Mana and the Final Fantasy series.[40]Yuji Horii, a fan of time travel fiction (such as the TV series The Time Tunnel), fostered a theme of time travel in his general story outline of Chrono Trigger with input from Akira Toriyama.[41][42] Horii liked the scenario of the grandfather paradox surrounding Marle.[38] Concerning story planning, Horii commented, \"If there's a fairground, I just write that there's a fairground; I don't write down any of the details. Then the staff brainstorm and come up with a variety of attractions to put in.\"[38] Sakaguchi contributed some minor elements, including the character Gato; he liked Marle's drama and reconciliation with her father.[38] Masato Kato subsequently edited and completed the outline by writing the majority of the game's story, including all the events of the 12,000 B.C. era.[4] He took pains to avoid what he described as \"a long string of errands...[such as] 'do this,' 'take this,' 'defeat these monsters,' or 'plant this flag'.\"[3] Kato and other developers held a series of meetings to ensure continuity, usually attended by around 30 personnel.[40] Kato and Horii initially proposed Crono's death, though they intended he stay dead; the party would have retrieved an earlier, living version of him to complete the quest.[3] Square deemed the scenario too depressing and asked that Crono be brought back to life later in the story.[3] Kato also devised the system of multiple endings because he could not branch the story out to different paths.[43] Yoshinori Kitase and Takashi Tokita then wrote various subplots.[4] Kato became friends with composer Yasunori Mitsuda during development, and they would collaborate on several future projects.[4] Katsuhisa Higuchi programmed the battle system, which hosted combat on the map without transition to a special battleground as most previous Square games had done.[40] Higuchi noted extreme difficulty in loading battles properly without slow-downs or a brief, black loading screen.[40] The game's use of animated monster sprites consumed much more memory than previous Final Fantasy games, which used static enemy graphics.[40]Hironobu Sakaguchi likened the development of Chrono Trigger to \"play[ing] around with Toriyama's universe,\" citing the inclusion of humorous sequences in the game that would have been \"impossible with something like Final Fantasy.\"[38] When Square Co. suggested a non-human player character, developers created Frog by adapting one of Toriyama's sketches.[38] The team created the End of Time to help players with hints, worrying that they might become stuck and need to consult a walkthrough.[38] The game's testers had previously complained that Chrono Trigger was too difficult; as Horii explained, \"It's because we know too much. The developers think the game's just right; that they're being too soft. They're thinking from their own experience. The puzzles were the same. Lots of players didn't figure out things we thought they'd get easily.\"[38] Sakaguchi later cited the unusual desire of beta testers to play the game a second time or \"travel through time again\" as an affirmation of the New Game + feature: \"Wherever we could, we tried to make it so that a slight change in your behavior caused subtle differences in people's reactions, even down to the smallest details...I think the second playthrough will hold a whole new interest.\"[38] The game's reuse of locations due to time traveling made bug-fixing difficult, as corrections would cause unintended consequences in other eras.[40]The team planned to release Chrono Trigger in late 1994, but release was pushed back to the following year.[38] Early alpha versions of Chrono Trigger were demonstrated at the 1994 and 1995 V-Jump festivals in Japan.[44] A few months prior to the game's release, Square shipped a beta version to magazine reviewers and game stores for review. An unfinished build of the game dated November 17, 1994, it contains unused music tracks, locations, and other features changed or removed from the final release—such as a dungeon named \"Singing Mountain\" and its eponymous tune.[45][46] Some names also differed; the character Soysaw (Slash in the US version) was known as Wiener, while Mayonnay (Flea in the US version) was named Ketchappa.[47] The ROM image for this early version was eventually uploaded to the internet, prompting fans to explore and document the game's differences, including two unused world map NPC character sprites and presumed additional sprites for certain non-player characters.[45] Around the game's release, Yuji Horii commented that Chrono Trigger \"went beyond [the development team's] expectations,\" and Hironobu Sakaguchi congratulated the game's graphic artists and field designers.[38] Sakaguchi intended to perfect the \"sense of dancing you get from exploring Toriyama's worlds\" in the event that they would make a sequel.[38]Chrono Trigger used a 32-megabit ROM cartridge with battery-backed RAM for saved games, lacking special on-cartridge coprocessors. The Japanese release of Chrono Trigger included art for the game's ending and running counts of items in the player's status menu.[48] Developers created the North American version before adding these features to the original build, inadvertently leaving in vestiges of Chrono Trigger's early development (such as the piece \"Singing Mountain\").[49] Hironobu Sakaguchi asked translator Ted Woolsey to localize Chrono Trigger for English audiences and gave him roughly thirty days to work.[50] Lacking the help of a modern translation team, he memorized scenarios and looked at drafts of commercial player's guides to put dialogue in context.[50] Woolsey later reflected that he would have preferred two-and-a-half months, and blames his rushed schedule on the prevailing attitude in Japan that games were children's toys rather than serious works.[50] Some of his work was cut due to space constraints, though he still considered Trigger \"one of the most satisfying games I ever worked on or played.\"[50][51] Nintendo of America censored certain dialogue, including references to breastfeeding, consumption of alcohol, and religion.[48] Square shipped Trigger with two world maps, and Japanese buyers who preordered received holographic foil cards.The original SNES edition of Chrono Trigger was released on the Wii download service Virtual Console in Japan on April 26, 2011,[14] in the US on May 16, 2011,[52] and in Europe on May 20, 2011.[53] Previously in April 2008, a Nintendo Power reader poll had identified Chrono Trigger as the third-most wanted game for the Virtual Console.[54] It went on to receive a perfect score of 10 out 10 on IGN.[55]Square released an enhanced port of Chrono Trigger developed by Tose in Japan for the Sony PlayStation in 1999. Square timed its release before that of Chrono Cross, the 1999 sequel to Chrono Trigger, to familiarize new players with story leading up to it.[42] This version included anime cut scenes created by original character designer Akira Toriyama's Bird Studio and animated by Toei Animation, as well as several bonus features, accessible after achieving various endings in the game. Scenarist Masato Kato attended planning meetings at Bird Studio to discuss how the ending cut scenes would illustrate subtle ties to Chrono Cross.[42] The port was later released in North America in 2001—along with a newly translated version of Final Fantasy IV—under the package title Final Fantasy Chronicles. Reviewers criticized Chronicles for lengthy load times and an absence of new in-game features.[56][57] This same iteration was also re-released as a downloadable game on the Playstation Network on October 4, 2011.[58]On July 2, 2008, Square Enix announced that they were officially planning to bring Chrono Trigger to the Nintendo DS handheld platform. Composer Yasunori Mitsuda was pleased with the project, exclaiming \"finally!\" after receiving the news from Square Enix and maintaining, \"it's still a very deep, very high-quality game even when you play it today. I'm very interested in seeing what kids today think about it when they play it.\"[59] Square retained Masato Kato to oversee the port.[3] He explained, \"I wanted it to be based on the original Super Nintendo release rather than the Playstation version. I thought we should look at the additional elements from the Playstation version, re-examine and re-work them to make it a complete edition. That’s how it struck me and I told the staff so later on.\"[3] Square Enix touted the game by displaying Akira Toriyama's original art at the 2008 Tokyo Game Show.[60]The DS re-release contains all of the bonus material from the PlayStation port, as well as other enhancements.[61] The added features include a more accurate and revised translation by Tom Slattery, a dual-screen mode which clears the top screen of all menus, a self-completing map screen, and a default \"run\" option.[62] It also featured the option to choose between two control schemes: one mirroring the original SNES controls, and the other making use of the DS's touch screen.[63] Masato Kato participated in development, overseeing the addition of the monster-battling Arena,[64] two new areas, the Lost Sanctum and the Dimensional Vortex, and a new ending that further foreshadows the events of Chrono Cross.[65] One of the areas within the Vortex uses the \"Singing Mountain\" song that was featured on the original Chrono Trigger soundtrack. These new dungeons met with mixed reviews; GameSpot called them \"frustrating\" and \"repetitive\", while IGN noted that \"the extra quests in the game connect extremely well.\"[66][67] It was a nominee for \"Best RPG for the Nintendo DS\" in IGN's 2008 video game awards.[68] The Nintendo DS version of Chrono Trigger was the 22nd best-selling game of 2008 in Japan.[69]Chrono Trigger was scored primarily by Yasunori Mitsuda, with contributions from veteran Final Fantasy composer Nobuo Uematsu, and one track composed by Noriko Matsueda. A sound programmer at the time, Mitsuda was unhappy with his pay and threatened to leave Square if he could not compose music.[7] Hironobu Sakaguchi suggested he score Chrono Trigger, remarking, \"maybe your salary will go up.\"[74] Mitsuda composed new music and drew on a personal collection of songs composed over the previous two years.[3] He reflected, \"I wanted to create music that wouldn't fit into any established genre...music of an imaginary world. The game's director, Masato Kato, was my close friend, and so I'd always talk with him about the setting and the scene before going into writing.\"[7] Mitsuda slept in his studio several nights, and attributed certain songs—such as the game's ending theme, To Far Away Times—to inspiring dreams.[74] He later attributed this song to an idea he was developing before Chrono Trigger, reflecting that the song was made in dedication to \"a certain person with whom I wanted to share a generation.\"[75] He also tried to use leitmotifs of the Chrono Trigger main theme to create a sense of consistency in the soundtrack.[76] Mitsuda wrote each song to be around two minutes long before repeating, unusual for Square's games at the time.[40] Mitsuda suffered a hard drive crash that lost around forty in-progress tracks.[59] After Mitsuda contracted stomach ulcers, Uematsu joined the project to compose ten songs and finish the score.[7] Mitsuda returned to watch the ending with the staff before the game's release, crying upon seeing the finished scene.[59]At the time of the game's release, the number of tracks and sound effects was unprecedented—the soundtrack spanned three discs in its 1995 commercial pressing.[9] Square also released a one-disc acid jazz arrangement called \"The Brink of Time\" by Guido that year. The Brink of Time came about because Mitsuda wanted to do something that no one else was doing, and he noted that acid jazz and its related genres were uncommon in the Japanese market.[76] Mitsuda considers Chrono Trigger a landmark title which helped mature his talent.[77] While Mitsuda later held that the title piece was \"rough around the edges,\" he maintains that it had \"significant influence on my life as a composer.\"[75] In 1999, Square produced another one-disc soundtrack to complement the PlayStation release of Trigger, featuring orchestral tracks used in cut scenes. Tsuyoshi Sekito composed four new pieces for the game's bonus features which weren't included on the soundtrack.[76] Some fans were displeased by Mitsuda's absence in creating the port, whose instruments sometimes aurally differed from the original game's.[76] Recently, Mitsuda arranged versions of music from the Chrono series for Play! video game music concerts, presenting the main theme, Frog's Theme, and To Far Away Times.[78] He worked with Square Enix to ensure that the Nintendo DS Chrono Trigger port's music would sound close to the Super Nintendo's version.[59] Mitsuda encouraged feedback about the game's soundtrack from contemporary children (who he thought would expect \"full symphonic scores blaring out of the speakers\").[3] Fans who preordered Chrono Trigger DS received a special music disc containing two orchestral arrangements of Chrono Trigger music directed by Natsumi Kameoka; Square Enix also held a random prize drawing for two signed copies of Chrono Trigger sheet music.[76][79] Mitsuda expressed difficulty in selecting the songs for the orchestral medley, eventually picking a song from each era and certain character themes.[75] Mitsuda later wrote:Fans have heavily remixed the soundtrack, producing over 700 tributes and several cover performance albums released over the internet or sold at retail.[80] These include Time & Space - A Tribute to Yasunori Mitsuda and Chrono Symphonic, the latter released by the remix website OverClocked ReMix.[81] Japanese fans often sell their remix work in compilation albums popularly called \"Dōjin\" by Western fans.[82] Music from Chrono Trigger was performed live by the Tokyo Symphony Orchestra in 1996 at the Orchestral Game Concert in Tokyo, Japan. A suite of music including Chrono Trigger is a part of the symphonic world-tour with video game music Play! A Video Game Symphony, where Mitsuda was in attendance for the concert's world-premiere in Chicago on May 27, 2006. His suite of Chrono music, comprising \"Reminiscence\", \"Chrono Trigger\", \"Chrono Cross~Time's Scar\", \"Frog's Theme\", and \"To Far Away Times\" was performed. Mitsuda has also appeared with the Eminence Symphony Orchestra as a special guest.[83] Video Games Live has also featured medleys from Chrono Trigger and Chrono Cross.[84] A medley of Music from Chrono Trigger made of one of the four suites of the Symphonic Fantasies concerts in September 2009 which was produced by the creators of the Symphonic Game Music Concert series, conducted by Arnie Roth.[85] Square re-released the game's soundtrack and a video interview with Yasunori Mitsuda in July 2009.[86]The game was a bestseller in Japan.[109] The game's SNES and PS1 iterations have shipped more than 2.36 million copies in Japan and 290,000 abroad.[11] The first two million copies sold in Japan were delivered in only two months.[110] Famicom Tsūshin gave Chrono Trigger first an 8 out of 10[111] and later a 9 out of 10 in their Reader Cross Review,[112] and the game ended 1995 as the third best-selling game of the year behind Dragon Quest VI: Realms of Revelation and Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest.[10] The game was met with substantial success upon release in North America, and its rerelease on the PlayStation as part of the Final Fantasy Chronicles package topped the NPD TRSTS PlayStation sales charts for over six weeks.[113][114][115] This version was later re-released again in 2003 as part of Sony's Greatest Hits line. Chrono Trigger DS has sold 490,000 copies in Japan, 240,000 in North America and 60,000 in Europe as of March 2009.[12]Chrono Trigger garnered much critical praise in addition to its brisk sales. Nintendo Power called it Square's \"biggest game ever\", citing improved graphics, sound, and gameplay over past RPG titles. Chrono Trigger won multiple awards from Electronic Gaming Monthly's 1995 video game awards, including Best Role-Playing Game, Best Music in a Cartridge-Based Game, and Best Super NES Game.[116] Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine described Trigger as \"original and extremely captivating\", singling out its graphics, sound and story as particularly impressive.[9][56] IGN commented that \"it may be filled with every imaginable console RPG cliché, but Chrono Trigger manages to stand out among the pack\" with \"a [captivating] story that doesn't take itself too serious  [sic]\" and \"one of the best videogame soundtracks ever produced\".[114] Other reviewers (such as the staff of RPGFan and RPGamer) have criticized the game's short length and relative ease compared to its peers.[115][117] Victoria Earl of Gamasutra praised the game design for balancing \"developer control with player freedom using carefully-designed mechanics and a modular approach to narrative.\"[118]Overall, critics lauded Chrono Trigger for its \"fantastic yet not overly complex\" story, simple but innovative gameplay, and high replay value afforded by multiple endings. Online score aggregator Game Rankings lists the original Super Nintendo version as the 2nd highest scoring RPG[119] and 24th highest scoring game ever reviewed. In 2009, Guinness World Records listed it as the 32nd most influential video game in history.[120] Nintendo Power listed the ending to Chrono Trigger as one of the greatest endings in Nintendo history, due to over a dozen endings that players can experience.[121] Tom Hall drew inspiration from Chrono Trigger and other console games in creating Anachronox, and used the campfire scene to illustrate the dramatic depth of Japanese RPGs.[122]Chrono Trigger is frequently listed among the greatest video games of all time. It has placed highly on all six of multimedia website IGN's \"top 100 games of all time\" lists—4th in 2002, 6th in early 2005, 13th in late 2005, 2nd in 2006, 18th in 2007, and 2nd in 2008.[123][124][125] Game Informer called it its 15th favourite game in 2001. Its staff thought that it was the best non-Final Fantasy title Square had produced at the time.[126] GameSpot included Chrono Trigger in \"The Greatest Games of All Time\" list released in April 2006, and it also appeared as 28th on an \"All Time Top 100\" list in a poll conducted by Japanese magazine Famitsu the same year.[127][128] In 2004, Chrono Trigger finished runner up to Final Fantasy VII in the inaugural GameFAQs video game battle. In 2008, readers of Dengeki Online voted it the eighth best game ever made.[129] Nintendo Power's twentieth anniversary issue named it the fifth best Super Nintendo game.[130] In 2012, it came 2nd place on GamesRadar's \"100 best games of all time\" list,[131] and 1st place on its \"Best JRPGs\" list.[132] GamesRadar named Chrono Trigger the 2nd best Super Nintendo game of all time, behind Super Metroid.[133]Chrono Trigger inspired several related releases; the first were three titles released for the Satellaview on July 31, 1995.[134] They included Chrono Trigger: Jet Bike Special, a racing video game based on a minigame from the original; Chrono Trigger: Character Library, featuring profiles on characters and monsters from the game; and Chrono Trigger: Music Library, a collection of music from the game's soundtrack. The contents of Character Library and Music Library were later included as extras in the PlayStation rerelease of Chrono Trigger. Production I.G created a 16-minute OVA entitled \"Nuumamonja: Time and Space Adventures\" which was shown at the Japanese V-Jump Festival of July 31, 1996.[135][136]There have been two notable attempts by Chrono Trigger fans to unofficially remake parts of the game for PC with a 3D graphics engine. Chrono Resurrection, an attempt at remaking ten small interactive cut scenes from Chrono Trigger, and Chrono Trigger Remake Project, which sought to remake the entire game,[137][138] were forcibly terminated by Square Enix by way of a cease and desist order.[139][140][141][142] Another group of fans created a sequel via a ROM hack of Chrono Trigger called Chrono Trigger: Crimson Echoes; developed from 2004 to 2009; although feature-length and virtually finished, it also was terminated through a cease & desist letter days before its May 2009 release. The letter also banned the dissemination of existing Chrono Trigger ROM hacks and documentation.[143] After the cease and desist was issued, an incomplete version of the game was leaked in May 2009, though due to the early state of the game, playability was limited.[144] This was followed by a more complete ROM leak in January 2011, which allowed the game to be played from beginning to end.[145]Square released a fourth Satellaview game in 1996, named Radical Dreamers: Nusumenai Hōseki. Having thought that Trigger ended with \"unfinished business\", scenarist Masato Kato wrote and directed the game.[42] Dreamers functioned as a side story to Chrono Trigger, resolving a loose subplot from its predecessor.[43] A short, text-based game relying on minimal graphics and atmospheric music, the game never received an official release outside Japan—though it was translated by fans to English in April 2003.[146] Square planned to release Radical Dreamers as an easter egg in the PlayStation edition of Chrono Trigger, but Kato was unhappy with his work and halted its inclusion.[42]Square released Chrono Cross for the Sony PlayStation in 1999. Cross is a sequel to Chrono Trigger featuring a new setting and cast of characters.[147] Presenting a theme of parallel worlds, the story followed the protagonist Serge—a teenage boy thrust into an alternate reality in which he died years earlier. With the help of a thief named Kid, Serge endeavors to discover the truth behind his apparent death and obtain the Frozen Flame, a mythical artifact.[147] Regarded by writer and director Masato Kato as an effort to \"redo Radical Dreamers properly\", Chrono Cross borrowed certain themes, scenarios, characters, and settings from Dreamers.[43] Yasunori Mitsuda also adapted certain songs from Radical Dreamers while scoring Cross.[148] Radical Dreamers was consequently removed from the series' main continuity, considered an alternate dimension.[149] Chrono Cross shipped 1.5 million copies and was almost universally praised by critics.[11][150][151]There are no plans for a new title, despite a statement from Hironobu Sakaguchi in 2001 that the developers of Chrono Cross wanted to make a new Chrono game.[152] The same year, Square applied for a trademark for the names Chrono Break in the United States and Chrono Brake in Japan. However, the United States trademark was dropped in 2003.[153] Director Takashi Tokita mentioned \"Chrono Trigger 2\" in a 2003 interview which has not been translated to English.[154] Yuji Horii expressed no interest in returning to the Chrono franchise in 2005, while Hironobu Sakaguchi remarked in April 2007 that his creation Blue Dragon was an \"extension of [Chrono Trigger].\"[155][156] During a Cubed³ interview on February 1, 2007, Square Enix's Senior Vice President Hiromichi Tanaka said that although no sequel is currently planned, some sort of sequel is still possible if the Chrono Cross developers can be reunited.[157] Yasunori Mitsuda has expressed interest in scoring a new game, but warned that \"there are a lot of politics involved\" with the series. He stressed that Masato Kato should participate in development.[74] The February 2008 issue of Game Informer ranked the Chrono series eighth among the \"Top Ten Sequels in Demand\", naming the games \"steadfast legacies in the Square Enix catalogue\" and asking, \"what's the damn holdup?!\"[158] In Electronic Gaming Monthly's June 2008 \"Retro Issue\", writer Jeremy Parish cited Chrono as the franchise video game fans would be most thrilled to see a sequel to.[159] In the first May Famitsu of 2009, Chrono Trigger placed 14th out of 50 in a vote of most-wanted sequels by the magazine's readers.[160] At E3 2009, SE Senior Vice President Shinji Hashimoto remarked, \"If people want a sequel, they should buy more!\"[161]In July 2010, Feargus Urquhart, replying to an interview question about what franchises he would like to work on, said that \"if [he] could come across everything that [he] played\", he would choose a Chrono Trigger game. At the time, Urquhart's company Obsidian Entertainment was making Dungeon Siege III for Square Enix. Urquhart said: \"You make RPGs, we make RPGs, it would be great to see what we could do together. And they really wanted to start getting into Western RPGs. And, so it kind of all ended up fitting together.\"[162][163] Yoshinori Kitase revealed in 2011 that he used the time travel mechanics of Chrono Trigger as a starting point for that of Final Fantasy XIII-2.[164]","title":"Chrono Trigger","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a7/Chrono_Trigger.jpg","developer":"Square","genre":"Role-playing"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Rock","description":"Chuck Rock is a slapstick side-scrolling platform video game of the early-to-mid 1990s, which was initially created by Core Design in 1991 and was subsequently ported to a large number of home consoles of the time over the next few years.Chuck Rock was both developed and published by Core Design in 1991 for the Atari ST and Amiga computers, and a year after, in 1992, for the Commodore 64, and in 1994 for the Amiga CD32. The game was subsequently published by Krisalis Software for the Acorn Archimedes. Virgin Interactive published the game for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis, Sega Master System, and the Sega Game Gear. Sony Imagesoft published the game for the Sega Mega-CD, Nintendo SNES, and Game Boy.In 1994, the game was among the most popular games for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis. The character of Chuck Rock himself was an iconic early character for Core Design before the introduction of Lara Croft in the 1996 game Tomb Raider, and the character of Chuck Rock himself and his family even featured in some UK comic books of the 1990s.Chuck Rock spawned two other video game sequels.The eponymous Chuck Rock is an overweight, square-jawed caveman characterized by loutish and lewd behaviour perhaps influenced by the lad culture of the 1990s. Chuck has a limited vocabulary (his favourite phrase being \"Unga Bunga\" and not much else), has a balding head cut into a punk-style mohawk, eats whole dinosaur-steaks raw in one bite, and has a penchant for picking up rocks and throwing them at things, hence his name. Chuck is a guitarist and singer (or shouter) in a rock band along with some other cavemen, his foxy blonde wife Ophelia Rock, and a long-haired dinosaur bass player; and whilst on stage he wears a long wig to hide his balding head.A direct sequel came in 1993 in the form of Chuck Rock II: Son of Chuck, which was also ported to several consoles like its predecessor. Chuck Rock II: Son of Chuck was more aimed at a younger audience than its predecessor, and the player character was not actually Chuck Rock himself but his infant son, Chuck Junior. It was not as well received by fans. Nonetheless around the time of the game's release, Core commissioned a comic strip in the long-running UK children's magazine LookIn, centering on the day-to-day lives of Chuck, Ophelia and Junior. As a meta-referential joke, Chuck Jr owned a 'SteggaDrive' console, as a reference to the Mega Drive name. A year later the magazine was closed (after almost 25 years), and the final strip saw Chuck being swept away from his boat, presumed dead but washing up on a tribal island and being revered as a God - as an inexplicable comic touch, mourners at his 'funeral' included then-Prime-Minister John Major.An spin-off to Chuck Rock came in the game BC Racers, released later in the same year as Chuck Rock II: Son of Chuck. BC Racers was released on the Mega-CD, Sega 32X and 3DO, and the format was changed from that of a platformer to that of a racing game. The game was designed by Toby Gard, who later created Lara Croft. BC Racers retained the characters of Chuck Rock as well as his son Chuck Junior. Other prehistoric racers include Millstone Rockafella, Brick Jagger and Jimi Handtrix. The game was generally well received among the fans of the consoles in question, and BC Racers was named the Best Sega CD Driving/Racing Game of the Year in GameFan's 1994 \"Megawards\" (Vol 3, Iss. 1). BC Racers was released as freeware two years later for the PC.Core promised an updated version of Chuck Rock for a next generation console, although it never materialized.","title":"Chuck Rock","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8a/Chuck_Rock_cover_MD.jpg/220px-Chuck_Rock_cover_MD.jpg","developer":"Core Design","genre":"Platform game"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilization_(video_game)","description":"","title":"Sid Meier's Civilization","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/ec/Civilizationboxart.jpg/256px-Civilizationboxart.jpg","developer":"MicroProse","genre":"Turn-based strategy"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ClayFighter","description":"ClayFighter is a fighting game released for the Super NES in 1993 and later ported to Mega Drive/Genesis in 1994.

The development process for the game, including creating the tools, was completed in less than six months from start to finish.[2] For the game's clay animation and stop motion, Interplay contracted a company other than Danger Productions, which had done the first game. Airey was very displeased with the quality of the clay work; in order to prove this to themselves and to test their new tools, the development team used the tools to implement the sprites of the original ClayFighter character Tiny into ClayFighter 2.

During this time, the red spot in the 7 Up logo was anthropomorphized: given arms, legs, a mouth, and sunglasses. British video games developer Virgin Interactive's American studio produced a platform game starring the 7 Up Spot, entitled Cool Spot. It was originally developed in 1993 at Virgin Games USA by David Perry for the Mega Drive/Genesis and Super NES and then ported by other teams to Sega Master System, Sega Game Gear, Game Boy, Amiga and DOS in 1994.[1]The title is a single-player platformer in which the player controls Cool Spot, who can jump, and attack by throwing soda bubbles, which could be thrown in all directions and while jumping. Cool Spot could also cling to and climb various things by jumping up in front of them. In each level the player must rescue other cool spots, who look exactly alike, from cages at the end of that level, which is not necessarily the point at the far right of the level map. In order to do so, the player is required to collect a certain number of \"spots\" that would change (usually increase) as the game progressed. \"Spots\" were placed across the level in large quantities, and were the game's substitute for items such as the coins in Super Mario Bros or Sonic the Hedgehog's gold rings (these were often used in this style of game, mostly for points and extra lives). A player's health is monitored by a humorous Cool Spot face that gradually bends forward and will eventually fall from its position as damage occurs. Damage is taken by touching enemies, their projectiles, or certain level obstacles. Each level is played with a time limit. If the clock reached zero, a life would be lost regardless of a player's health. If Spot lost a life and had no more lives left, the game would end, taking the player back to the title screen. The game had no save feature but did use checkpoints in the form of flagpoles. Once walked past, the flag would raise and a trumpet would sound. If a player lost a life after reaching a checkpoint, the player could restart further in the game. If the player successfully collects enough Spots to enter the Bonus Stage after defeating a level, it is possible to collect Continues by grabbing a letter hidden within the stage. Depending on the version of the game, all letters either spell \"UNCOLA\" (7 Up's slogan), or \"VIRGIN\" (the game's developer). If a Continue letter is collected, Spot will be able to restart on the level he was on at the time of losing his last life, although his total points will be reset.While Cool Spot was a side-scrolling platform game, its sequel, Spot Goes To Hollywood, was more 3D in orientation and featured gameplay inside various movies. Despite excellent visuals, its isometric perspective and unusual controls made it an exceedingly difficult game. This game, published once again by Virgin Interactive, was developed by Eurocom.

While Tops can throw darts to damage enemies from a distance, Rex is confined to close combat by punching them or swinging his tail.[3] Each dinosaur character can defeat enemies by jumping on them, and at any point the player may relegate control to their human riders, who can freeze enemies in place by using a special energy device. While controlling the children, the dinosaurs become immobile and may be used as platforms themselves to reach otherwise inaccessible items. The game supports up to two players who are given alternating turns at play each time the other loses a life.[3]DinoCity was developed and published by Irem Corporation in 1992, and was led by project directors K. Okada and Y. Takashima.[4] The game was based on the American film Adventures in Dinosaur City which has been released worldwide earlier that year, with the Japanese title Dinowars Kyōryū Ōkoku e no Daibōken being the same name as the Japanese version of the movie.[5] While many of the game's characters including the heroes Rex, Tops, Timmy, Jamie and villains Mr. Big and The Rockeys were taken directly from the film, they were largely re-designed into a more anime-based style by staff artists using the pseudonyms \"Munou no Hito\" and \"SDR 200\".[4] Much of the game's art direction utilizes a colorful, cartoon-like approach to environments and enemies as opposed to the darker presentation of the original film.[6] The music for DinoCity was produced by Irem in-house composer Hiroshi Ebihara, who had previously collaborated on the score to Super R-Type.[4] Although no official soundtrack was released, select tracks were made available for listening from in-game sound test menu accessible from the title screen.The North American version was originally marketed by Irem America under the title \"Dinosaurs\" shortly after the game's Japanese release in July, with the finalization of the game's title coming just before its English release.[7] Although the title was originally marked for an August release, it would later be pushed back to the following September.[8] Beginning in early 1993, Irem America held a magazine promotion where players could receive an official DinoCity t-shirt featuring Rex by sending in two UPC labels from specified Irem games.[9]DinoCity received mostly good to average reviews during its North American release. Electronic Gaming Monthly was impressed with the game's \"colorful\" graphics and \"cute\" character designs, stating that it \"seems geared for kids, but adults can play too.\"[12] However, the magazine ultimately declared that \"although [the game] enjoys some of the nicest SNES wallpaper yet, the theme is less than exhilerating [sic] while the pace remains stuck in molasses ... the overall execution of this title was cooler than it should be.\"[12] GamePro magazine similarly declared that \"the colorful cartoon-style graphics create an ancient, humorous atmosphere ... thematically the game seems aimed at the younger set.\"[13] Despite its target demographic, the magazine still found it to be challenging enough for \"intermediate adventurers.\"[13] Nintendo Power praised the game's \"colorful and very detailed\" graphics and \"very good\" music, but found the overall experience to be \"a little too difficult for beginning players.\"[6]A more contemporary review of DinoCity from the website Allgame was largely in agreement with earlier editors, referring to it as \"a (relatively) challenging and interesting game featuring a mind-boggling variety of levels.\"[11] The game's vibrant graphics were once again touched upon, with the website calling them \"not only adorable, [but] sophisticated as well. The backgrounds vary greatly from level to level and the characters are nicely animated and drawn in a cartoon-like manner. Also, the game is colorful to the extreme.\".[11] IGN placed the game tenth on its \"Top 10 Prehistoric Games\" list in February 2007, stating that \"If you never got a chance to play Dino City on the SNES, we feel bad for you.\"[15] DinoCity maintains a 69% average score from the aggregate review website Game Rankings.[14]","title":"DinoCity","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f7/DinocitySNES_boxart.jpg/220px-DinocitySNES_boxart.jpg","developer":"Irem","genre":"2D action"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dino_Dini%27s_Soccer","description":"","title":"Dino Dini's Soccer","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/80/Dino_Dinis_Soccer_cover_art.jpg/256px-Dino_Dinis_Soccer_cover_art.jpg","developer":"Dino Dini","genre":"Sports"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirt_Racer","description":"Dirt Racer is a Europe-exclusive video game for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System; which was released in 1995.

It aired from September 4, 1993 to February 23, 1994 in first-run syndication (after a \"preview airing\" on The Disney Channel in early 1993[1]). The syndicated run was available both separately, and as part of The Disney Afternoon. Reruns of the show continued in syndication until 1995. The show was last seen on Toon Disney, but was taken off the schedule in late 2004.The premise of the series was that Bonkers D. Bobcat, an anthropomorphic bobcat who was a popular cartoon star, had washed out of show business and became a cop. He was made the junior partner of Detective Lucky Piquel, a grim and ill-tempered human who hates toons. Throughout the series, the pair work together to solve crimes in the Hollywood, Los Angeles, California region. Bonkers repeatedly tried to win Piquel's praise, but usually just ended up ruining missions with his antics.After multiple episodes of working with Bonkers, Piquel was given an FBI job in Washington, D.C., and with great glee was finally able to leave Bonkers, but finally realized that after all the time spent hating working with Bonkers he had grown to love him[citation needed]. At the end of the \"Lucky\" episodes, Bonkers was given a new partner, the attractive Officer Miranda Wright. Although also human, she was far more patient and tolerant of his antics than was Piquel[citation needed]. With Miranda, Bonkers was more the brunt of the slapstick.The series played 65 episodes, as part of The Disney Afternoon. They were not created in chronological order: The \"Miranda\" episodes were actually produced first, excluding the two-part series premiere, which featured Piquel and Bonkers meeting for the first time[citation needed]. This discrepancy becomes evident when observing the look of the main character in both sets of episodes[citation needed]. In the Raw Toonage shorts, Bonkers was orange with one brown spot, golf-club-like ears, and an undone tail. When the Lucky Piquel episodes (produced by Robert Taylor) were made, the character had a major overhaul: skinnier ears, two black spots on each his tufts, black Tigger-like stripes on his tail, and a different uniform. The Miranda Wright-era episodes (produced by Duane Capizzi & Robert Hathcock) use Bonkers's original look from Raw Toonage. The series also occasionally featured episodes of \"cartoons\" from Bonkers's pre-police actor days, all lifted from the Raw Toonage series.The Raw Toonage shorts were an after-thought of production[citation needed]. While the Bonkers series was in pre-production, the Raw Toonage team, headed by Larry Latham produced 12 \"He's Bonkers\" shorts. These shorts were, in the context of Bonkers, explained to be some of the shorts Bonkers made at Wackytoons Studios before he was fired. The animated short entitled Petal to the Metal was originally shown in theaters in 1992 before the feature movie 3 Ninjas,[2] while the rest were shown on the program Raw Toonage. In syndication, the shorts were collected into four full episodes with fillers of new material in between.Meanwhile, Duane Capizzi, making his producing debut, was brought into the fold and teamed with animation veteran Robert Hathcock and charged with making 65 episodes (a full season's worth in syndication). The episodes theoretically would feature Bonkers with Wright as his partner. These episodes came back from overseas animation studios looking less than spectacular, causing considerable concern at Disney[citation needed]. Ultimately, the original team was replaced, and a team headed by Robert Taylor came in[citation needed]. Only 19 of the original-order shows survived to air[citation needed]; they are what is known as the \"Miranda Wright episodes\" of Bonkers. Nine of these episodes were aired on The Disney Channel during the first half of 1993 as a preview for the series,[1] before its syndicated premiere in the fall. The 19 Miranda Wright episodes are shown toward the end of the series in the official continuity[citation needed]. Greg Weisman (co-creator of Disney's Gargoyles) worked on the Miranda episodes, and Bonkers's relationship with Miranda inspired Goliath's relationship with Elisa Maza[citation needed].Taylor threw out the old premise of the show[citation needed]. He replaced it with the Lucky Piquel scenario, but his episodes were revised and established to occur before the original episodes. 42 episodes of the \"Piquel Era\" were made, including one (New Partners On The Block), which attempted to bridge the gap between the two somewhat contradictory storylines.The syndicated version of the series (which omits several of the original episodes that survived first-run) was last seen on Toon Disney until late 2004.New Partners on the Block was a transition episode that showed how Bonkers went from having Lucky Piquel as a partner to having Miranda Wright as his newest partner. The episode was much like the pilot episode/movie \"Going Bonkers\", using the CGI rain and bringing back the characters that were associated with Bonkers, those characters being Fawn Deer, Jitters A. Dog, and Grumbles Grizzly and, unlike the pilot, had more speaking and screen time.At the end of the episode, Bonkers, along with Miranda and Lucky, captured the main villain, bomber Fireball Frank, thus making Bonkers and Miranda a team and giving Lucky a job as an FBI Agent in Washington, D.C. Piquel, his family Dyl (wife) and Marylin (daughter), Fall-Apart Rabbit, Toots and Brodrick the toon radio all subsequently relocated to Washington, D.C., allowing them to be written out of the show.This episode was removed from rotation in the United States after the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing due to its bombing/terrorism plot, and was consequently never rerun on Toon Disney, even before Disney's stricter censorship policies following 9/11. (Another episode, \"Fall Apart Bomb Squad,\" was also not shown on Toon Disney for similar reasons. However, both episodes have been rerun in Europe.)[citation needed]Bonkers D. Bobcat (voiced by Jim Cummings) is an overly energetic and hyperactive cartoon anthropomorphic bobcat that works in the Toon Division of the Hollywood PD. Once a big name cartoon star for Wackytoons Studios, he was fired due to his show being bumped out of first place in the ratings. He was introduced to law enforcement when he unknowingly saved cartoon celebrity Donald Duck from a park mugger (mostly due to the help of officer Lucky Piquel) and was given full credit for the mugger's capture.For his actions, he received the Citizen of Valor award by the Chief of Police, Leonard Kanifky. Bonkers, while soaking in the praise, told the chief about how his experiences starring in police cartoons helped in the capture of the mugger. Chief Kanifky mistook his fictional roles as real life, worldwide police accounts and, thinking that Bonkers would be a benefit to the police force, asked if the former cartoon star would like a job working for the Hollywood PD, which Bonkers accepted because of his recent unemployment from Wackytoons Studios. Bonkers then requested Lucky as his partner, and the two established the beginning of the Toon Division. When Bonkers first came home to Lucky's house, he was treated as a sort of adopted son to Lucky.Though Bonkers means well, he usually messes up cases for his fellow officers due to his lack of experience in law enforcement and his wild, exaggerated, cartoony nature. He even tells Lucky at one point that he is not good at logical police thinking because he is a toon. It is interesting to note that not only does Bonkers make a design change between the 'Lucky' and 'Miranda' episodes, his personality is slightly tweaked as well. Despite being a police officer, Bonkers is unarmed. However, he still carries a badge nevertheless.In the 'Miranda' episodes, he's portrayed as a rather clumsy, somewhat foolish character who ends up being the show's punching bag. In the Lucky episodes, he's less of a buffoon and more of an Inspector Clouseau-type, in control of himself (though still hyperactive), and carries an extensive knowledge about the toon and their behavior, which is an asset on cases dealing with rogue toons (Lucky would very rarely acknowledge this, although he knows it deep inside[citation needed]). The joke is his lack of law enforcement experience and procedure is still his \"Achilles' heel.\"Bonkers appears as a teenager in the television series Kids Character.Bonkers was released on three VHS tapes in 1995 by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment, each containing no more than two episodes. They include the following:To date, none of the series has yet been released on DVD, and Disney has not revealed any plans to do so.Bonkers inspired three video games. The first, released for Super NES, Bonkers, was released December 15, 1994. In the game, Bonkers is on his first case alone, and must retrieve the Toontown treasure of the Sorcerer's Hat (from Fantasia), the Mermaid's Voice (The Little Mermaid), and the Magic Lamp (Aladdin).The second game, for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis on October 1, 1994, was also titled Bonkers. In the game, Bonkers notices that an Employee of the Month award will be given to a cop who captures 4 criminals: Ma Tow Truck (from the episode \"Calling all cars\"), The Rat (from the episode \"I oughta be in toons), Mr. Big (from the episode \"Hamster Housegeust\"), and Harry the Handbag (from the episode \"In the Bag\").

It is considered one of the most significant and influential titles in the video game industry, for having ushered in the popularity of the first-person shooter genre. The original game is divided into three nine-level episodes and distributed via shareware and mail order. The Ultimate Doom, an updated release of the original game featuring a fourth episode, was released in 1995 and sold at retail.In Doom, players assume the role of an unnamed space marine, who became popularly known as \"Doomguy\", fighting his way through hordes of invading demons from Hell. With one third of the game, nine levels, distributed as shareware, Doom was played by an estimated 10 million people within two years of its release, popularizing the mode of gameplay and spawning a gaming subculture. In addition to popularizing the FPS genre, it pioneered immersive 3D graphics, networked multiplayer gaming, and support for customized additions and modifications via packaged files in a data archive known as \"WADs\". As a sign of its effect on the industry, first-person shooter games from the genre's boom in the 1990s, helped in no small part by the game's release, became known simply as \"Doom clones\". Its graphic violence, as well as satanic imagery, made Doom the subject of controversy.The Doom franchise was later continued with the follow-up Doom II: Hell on Earth (1994) and numerous mission packs, including Master Levels for Doom II (1995), and Final Doom (1996). Originally released for PC DOS, the games have later been ported to numerous other platforms. Once the game's source code was released in 1997, it spawned even more adaptations, as fans further ported the code to countless devices. The series started to lose mainstream appeal as the technology of the Doom game engine was surpassed in the mid-1990s, although fans have continued making WADs, speedruns, and modifications to the original. The franchise again received popular attention in 2004 with the release of Doom 3, a retelling of the original game using new technology, and an associated 2005 Doom motion picture. Doom 4 was announced as in production in 2008 and was later retitled simply as Doom.Doom, a science fiction/horror themed video game, has a background which is given in the game's instruction manual; the rest of the story is advanced with short messages displayed between each section of the game (called episodes), the action as the player character progresses through the levels, and some visual cues.The player takes the role of an unnamed space marine (\"Doomguy\") who has been punitively posted to Mars after assaulting his commanding officer, who ordered his unit to fire on civilians. The Martian space marine base acts as security for the Union Aerospace Corporation, a multi-planetary conglomerate, which is performing secret experiments with teleportation by creating gateways between the two moons of Mars, Phobos and Deimos. Mars is considered by space marines to be the dullest assignment imaginable. This all changes when the UAC experiments go horribly wrong. Computer systems on Phobos malfunction, Deimos disappears entirely, and \"something fragging evil\" starts pouring out of the gateway, killing or possessing all UAC personnel.The third episode, called Inferno, begins after the marine climbs off Deimos to the surface. The marine fights his way through Hell and defeats the Spider Mastermind that planned the invasion. Then a hidden doorway back to Earth opens for the hero, who has \"proven too tough for Hell to contain\". However, a burning city and a rabbit's head impaled on a stake (named in The Ultimate Doom as the marine's pet rabbit, Daisy) show that the demons have invaded Earth, setting the stage for Hell on Earth. The sequel retcons the events of Doom as an alien invasion of the Mars moon bases.In The Ultimate Doom expansion, in the fourth episode Thy Flesh Consumed, it tells that the marine fought valiantly against the hordes of demons that the Spider Mastermind sent through that hidden doorway but ultimately the forces of Hell prevailed in the invasion of Earth. The locales of Thy Flesh Consumed are varied, including a mix of high-tech bases and demonic temples, though the atmosphere appears to be Earth.Being a first-person shooter, Doom is experienced through the eyes of the main character. This character is not named throughout the game. The game's designer, John Romero, has pointed out that this is so the player feels more involved in the game: \"There was never a name for the DOOM marine because it's supposed to be you.\"[2] At its core, the gameplay is similar to classic shooter games, presenting the player with the challenge of surviving while shooting every enemy in sight, but with its pseudo-3D first-person perspective giving environments a spatial representation that has a major effect on the level design and gameplay experience.[3]In order for the game to be completed, the marine must fight through Phobos, Deimos, and then Hell itself, each presented as an episode containing eight distinct levels, along with an optional ninth hidden level for each one. The Ultimate Doom, the retail store version of the game, adds a fourth episode, Thy Flesh Consumed. Set between the end of Doom and before Doom II and featuring the first contribution of Tim Willits to the Doom franchise, the fourth episode was designed for expert Doom players seeking a major challenge (being considerably more difficult than the original episodes).The objective of each level is simply to locate the exit room that leads to the next area, marked with an exit sign and/or a special kind of door, while surviving all hazards on the way. Among the obstacles are demonic monsters, pits of toxic or radioactive slime, ceilings that lower and crush anything below them, and locked doors which require a keycard, skull-shaped key device, or a remote switch to be located. The levels are sometimes labyrinthine and feature plenty of items such as additional ammo, health increases and other \"power-ups\" along the way, as well as the occasional secret areas which are not immediately obvious as a reward for players who explore more carefully. To ease navigation through the levels, a full screen automap is available and shows the areas explored to that point. Many versions of Doom (and its sequels) include secret levels which are accessed by the player discovering alternate exits, often hidden behind secret doors, hidden passageways, or in areas which are difficult to reach. Despite carrying masses of high-tech weaponry, the main character can still run at blistering speeds.Doom is notable for the weapons arsenal available to the marine, which became prototypical for first-person shooters. The player character starts armed only with a pistol, and fists in case the ammunition runs out, but larger weapons can be picked up: these are a chainsaw, a shotgun, a chaingun, a rocket launcher, a plasma rifle, and finally the immensely powerful BFG 9000. There is a wide array of power-ups, such as a backpack that increases the player character's ammunition-carrying capacity, armor, first aid kits to restore health, the berserk pack which both restores health and causes the player's punching attack to deal enormous damage, supernatural blue orbs (named soul spheres in the manuals) that boost the player character's health up to a maximum of 200%, nightvision, computer maps (which show every area of the level), partial invisibility, and protective suits that allow the player to survive in toxic acids.The enemy monsters in Doom make up the central gameplay element. The player character faces them in large numbers, with the number generally increased when the higher of the game's five difficulty levels is chosen when starting a new game. There are 10 types of monsters, including possessed undead humans as well as demons, all which vary in many ways. The monsters have very simple behavior, consisting of either walking toward their opponent, or attacking by throwing fireballs, biting, and scratching. They will fight each other if one monster is accidentally harmed by another (though most monsters are not harmed by the ranged attacks of their own kind).Aside from the single player game mode, Doom features two multiplayer modes playable over a network: \"cooperative\", in which two to four players team up, and \"deathmatch\", in which two to four players play against each other. Online multiplayer was eventually made available through the DWANGO service.[4]The development of Doom started in 1992, when John D. Carmack developed a new 3D game engine, the Doom engine, while the rest of the id Software team finished the Wolfenstein 3D prequel, Spear of Destiny. When the game design phase began in late 1992, the main thematic influences were the science fiction action film Aliens and the horror film Evil Dead II. The title of the game was picked by John Carmack: \"There is a scene in The Color of Money where Tom Cruise  [sic] shows up at a pool hall with a custom pool cue in a case. 'What do you have in there?' asks someone. 'Doom.' replied Cruise with a cocky grin. That, and the resulting carnage, was how I viewed us springing the game on the industry.\"[5]Designer Tom Hall wrote an elaborate design document called the Doom Bible, according to which the game would feature a detailed storyline, multiple player characters, and a number of interactive features.[6] However, many of his ideas were discarded during development in favor of simpler design primarily advocated by John Carmack, resulting in Hall in the end being forced to resign due to not contributing effectively in the direction the rest of the team was going. Most of the level design that ended up in the final game is that of John Romero and Sandy Petersen. The graphics, by Adrian Carmack, Kevin Cloud and Gregor Punchatz, were modelled in various ways: although much was drawn or painted, several of the monsters were built from sculptures in clay or latex, and some of the weapons are toy guns from Toys \"R\" Us. A heavy metal-ambient soundtrack was supplied by Bobby Prince.[4]Doom '​s primary distinguishing feature at the time of its release was its relatively realistic 3D graphics. The advance from id Software's previous game Wolfenstein 3D was enabled by several new features in the Doom engine, including height differences (all rooms in Wolfenstein 3D have the same height), non-perpendicular walls (all walls in Wolfenstein 3D run along a rectangular grid), full texture mapping of all surfaces (in Wolfenstein 3D, floors and ceilings are flat colors) and varying light levels and custom palettes (all areas in Wolfenstein 3D are fully lit at the same brightness). The latter contributed to Doom '​s visual authenticity, atmosphere and gameplay, as the use of darkness to frighten or confuse the player was nearly unheard of in games released prior to Doom; palette modifications were used to enhance effects such as the berserk power which tints the player's vision red.In contrast to the static levels of Wolfenstein 3D, those in Doom are highly dynamic: platforms can lower and rise, floors can rise sequentially to form staircases, and bridges can rise and fall. The lifelike environment was enhanced further by the stereo sound system, which made it possible to roughly determine the direction and distance of a sound effect. The player is kept on guard by the grunts and growls of monsters, and receives occasional clues to finding secret areas in the form of sounds of hidden doors opening remotely. As in Wolfenstein 3D, enemies can also become aware of the player's presence by hearing distant gunshots.John Carmack had to make use of several tricks for these features to run smoothly on home computers of 1993. Most significantly, the Doom engine and levels are not truly three-dimensional; they are internally represented on a single plane, with height differences stored separately as displacements. (A similar trick is still used by many games to create huge outdoor environments.) This allows a two point perspective projection, with several design limitations: for example, it is not possible for the Doom engine to render one room over another. However, thanks to its two-dimensional property, the environment can be rendered very quickly, using a binary space partitioning method in conjunction with raycasting. Another benefit was the clarity of the automap, as that could be rendered with 2D vectors without any risk of overlapping. Additionally, the BSP tree technology created by Bruce Naylor was used.[7]Another important feature of the Doom engine is its modular data files, which allow most of the game's content to be replaced by loading custom WAD files. Wolfenstein 3D was not designed to be expandable, but fans had nevertheless figured out how to create their own levels for it, and Doom was designed to further extend the possibilities. The ability to create custom scenarios contributed significantly to the game's popularity (see the section on WADs, below).The development of Doom was surrounded by much anticipation. The large number of posts in Internet newsgroups about Doom led to the SPISPOPD joke,[8] to which a nod was given in the game in the form of a cheat code. In addition to news, rumors and screenshots, unauthorized leaked alpha versions also circulated online. Many years later these alpha versions were sanctioned by id Software because of historical interest; they reveal how the game progressed from its early design stages.[9] The first public version of Doom was uploaded to Software Creations BBS and an FTP server at the University of Wisconsin–Madison on December 10, 1993.[10]Doom was released as shareware, with people encouraged to distribute it further. Although most users did not purchase the registered version, over one million copies have been sold, and the popularity helped the sales of later games in the Doom series that were not released as shareware. In 1995, The Ultimate Doom (version 1.9, including Episode IV) was released, making this the first time that Doom was sold commercially in stores.In a press release dated January 1, 1993, id Software had written that they expected Doom to be \"the number one cause of decreased productivity in businesses around the world.\"[11] This prediction came true at least in part: Doom became a major problem at workplaces, both occupying the time of employees and clogging computer networks with traffic caused by deathmatches. Intel, Lotus Development and Carnegie Mellon University are among many organizations reported to form policies specifically disallowing Doom-playing during work hours. At the Microsoft campus, Doom was by one account equal to a \"religious phenomenon\".[4]In late 1995, Doom was estimated to be installed on more computers worldwide than Microsoft's new operating system Windows 95, despite million-dollar advertising campaigns for the latter.[citation needed] The game's popularity prompted Bill Gates to briefly consider buying id Software,[4] and led Microsoft to develop a Windows 95 port of Doom to promote the operating system as a gaming platform. One such presentation to promote Windows 95 had Bill Gates digitally superimposed into the game.[12] The 1995 release of Microsoft Excel 95 included a Doom-esque secret level as an Easter egg containing portraits of the programmers among other things.[13]The popularity of Doom led to the development of expansion packs and alternate versions based on the same game engine, including The Ultimate Doom (1995), Final Doom (1996), and Doom 64 (1997). Doom became a \"killer app\" that all capable consoles and operating systems were expected to have, and versions of Doom have subsequently been released for the following systems: DOS, Microsoft Windows, Linux, Amiga, Apple Macintosh, SNES, Sega 32X, Sony PlayStation, Game Boy Advance, iOS, Symbian OS, RISC OS, Atari Jaguar, Sega Saturn, Nintendo 64, Tapwave Zodiac, 3DO, Xbox, and Xbox Live Arcade. Some of these were bestsellers even many years after initial release.[15] In 2013, a version of Doom was ported to the Commodore VIC-20, a vintage 1980 introductory home computer having only 3,583 bytes of BASIC RAM, an 8 bit 6502A processor with rudimentary graphics, no sprites and just 8 colors.[16]The ability for others to create custom levels and otherwise modify the game, in the form of custom WAD files (short for \"Where's All the Data?\"),[17] turned out to be a particularly popular aspect of Doom. Gaining the first large mod-making community, Doom affected the culture surrounding first-person shooters, and also the industry. Several future professional game designers started their careers making Doom WADs as a hobby, among them Tim Willits, who later became the lead designer at id Software.The first level editors appeared in early 1994, and additional tools have been created that allow most aspects of the game to be edited. Although the majority of WADs contain one or several custom levels mostly in the style of the original game, others implement new monsters and other resources, and heavily alter the gameplay; several popular movies, television series, other video games and other brands from popular culture have been turned into Doom WADs by fans, including Aliens, Star Wars, The X-Files, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,The Simpsons, South Park, Sailor Moon, Dragon Ball Z, Red Faction, The Thing, Pokémon, Batman and Sonic the Hedgehog.[18] Some works, like the Theme Doom Patch, combined enemies from several films, such as Aliens, Predator and The Terminator. Some add-on files were also made that changed the sounds made by the various characters and weapons.Around 1994 and 1995, WADs were primarily distributed online over bulletin board systems or sold in collections on compact discs in computer shops, sometimes bundled with editing guide books. FTP servers became the primary method in later years. A few WADs have been released commercially, including the Master Levels for Doom II, which was released in 1995 along with Maximum Doom, a CD containing 1,830 WADs that had been downloaded from the Internet. Several thousand WADs have been created in total: the idgames FTP archive contains over 13,000 files,[19] and this represents only a fraction of the complete output of Doom fans. Third party programs were also written to handle the loading of various WADs, since the game is a DOS game and all commands had to be entered on the command line to run. A typical launcher would allow the player to select which files to load from a menu, making it much easier to start. In 1995, WizardWorks Software released the D!Zone pack featuring hundreds of levels for Doom and Doom II.[20] D!Zone was reviewed in Dragon by Jay & Dee; Jay gave the pack 1 out of 5 stars, while Dee gave the pack 1½ stars.[20]Doom was widely praised in the gaming press and is broadly considered to be one of the most important and influential titles in gaming history. In 1996, Computer Gaming World ranked it as the fifth best video game of all time.[23] In 2001, Doom was voted the number one game of all time in a poll among over 100 game developers and journalists conducted by GameSpy.[24] In 2003, IGN ranked it as the 44th top video game of all time and also called it \"the breakthrough game of 1993\", adding: \"Its arsenal of powerful guns (namely the shotgun and BFG), intense level of gore and perfect balance of adrenaline-soaked action and exploration kept this gamer riveted for years.\"[25] PC Gamer proclaimed Doom the most influential game of all time in its ten-year anniversary issue in April 2004. In 2004, readers of Retro Gamer voted Doom as the ninth top retro game, with the editors commenting: \"Only a handful of games can claim that they’ve changed the gaming world, and Doom is perhaps the most qualified of them all.\"[26] In 2005, IGN ranked it as the 39th top game.[27] On March 12, 2007, The New York Times reported that Doom was named to a list of the ten most important video games of all time, the so called game canon.[28] The Library of Congress took up this video game preservation proposal and began with the games from this list.[29][30] In 2009, GameTrailers ranked Doom as number one \"breakthrough PC game\".[31] That same year, Game Informer put Doom sixth on their list of the games of all time, stating that it gave \"the genre the kick start it needed to rule the gaming landscape two decades later.\"[32] Game Informer staff also put it sixth on their 2001 list of the 100 best games ever.[33] In 2012, Time named it one of the 100 greatest video games of all time as \"it established the look and feel of later shooters as surely as Xerox PARC established the rules of the virtual desktop,\" adding that \"its impact also owes a lot to the gonzo horror sensibility of its designers, including John Romero, who showed a bracing lack of restraint in their deployment of gore and Satanic iconography.\"[34] Including Doom on the list of the greatest games of all time, GameSpot wrote that \"despite its numerous appearances in other formats and on other media, longtime fans will forever remember the original 1993 release of Doom as the beginning of a true revolution in action gaming.\"[35]Doom was notorious for its high levels of graphic violence[36] and satanic imagery, which generated controversy from a broad range of groups. Yahoo! Games listed it as one of the top ten most controversial games of all time.[37] It was criticized by religious organizations for its diabolic undertones and was dubbed a \"mass murder simulator\" by critic and Killology Research Group founder David Grossman.[38] Doom prompted fears that the then-emerging virtual reality technology could be used to simulate extremely realistic killing.The game again sparked controversy throughout a period of school shootings in the United States when it was found that Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, who committed the Columbine High School massacre in 1999, were avid players of the game. While planning for the massacre, Harris said that the killing would be \"like playing Doom\", and \"it'll be like the LA riots, the Oklahoma bombing, WWII, Vietnam, Duke Nukem and Doom all mixed together\", and that his shotgun was \"straight out of the game\".[39] A rumor spread afterwards that Harris had designed a Doom level that looked like the high school, populated with representations of Harris's classmates and teachers, and that Harris practiced for his role in the shootings by playing the level over and over. Although Harris did design Doom levels, none of them were based on Columbine High School.[40]While Doom and other violent video games have been blamed for nationally covered school shootings, 2008 research featured by Greater Good Science Center[41] shows that the two are not closely related. Harvard medical school researchers Cheryl Olson and Lawrence Kutner found that violent video games did not correlate to school shootings. The U.S. Secret Service and Department of Education analyzed 37 incidents of school violence and sought to develop a profile of school shooters, they discovered that the most common traits among shooters were that they were male and had histories of depression and attempted suicide. While many of the killers—like the vast majority of young teenage boys—did play video games, this study did not find a relationship between game play and school shootings. In fact, only one eighth of the shooters showed any special interest in violent video games; far less than the number of shooters who seemed attracted to books and movies with violent content.[42]Doom has appeared in several forms in addition to video games, including a Doom comic book, four novels by Dafydd Ab Hugh and Brad Linaweaver (loosely based on events and locations in the games), a Doom board game and a live-action film starring Karl Urban and The Rock released in 2005. The game's development and impact on popular culture is also the subject of the book Masters of Doom by David Kushner.The Doom series remained dormant between 1997 and 2000, when Doom 3 was announced. A retelling of the original Doom using entirely new graphics technology, Doom 3 was hyped to provide as large a leap in realism and interactivity as the original game and helped renew interest in the franchise when it was released in 2004. After the Doom 4 project development was scrapped in 2013, id's Tim Willits said that the next game in the Doom series was still the team's focus, but it has not been confirmed to be titled Doom 4.[43] It was renamed to simply Doom in 2014.Doom was influential and dozens of new first-person shooter titles appeared following Doom '​s release, and they were often referred to as \"Doom clones\" rather than \"first-person shooters\". The term \"Doom clone\" was used to described the style of gameplay in Doom-like games. While the term was initially popular, it was after 1996 gradually replaced by \"first-person shooter\", around 1998 the phrase \"first-person shooter\" had firmly superseded \"Doom clone\". Some of these were certainly \"clones\"—hastily assembled and quickly forgotten—others explored new grounds of the genre and were highly acclaimed. Many of the games closely imitated features in Doom such as the selection of weapons and cheat codes. Doom '​s principal rivals were Apogee's Rise of the Triad and Looking Glass Studios' System Shock. The popularity of Star Wars-themed WADs is rumored to have been the factor that prompted LucasArts to create their first-person shooter Dark Forces.[44]Also, the Doom game engine was licensed by id Software to several other companies as well, who released their own games based on it, including Heretic, Hexen: Beyond Heretic, Strife and HacX. A Doom-based game called Chex Quest was released in 1996 by Ralston Foods as a promotion to increase cereal sales,[45] and the United States Marine Corps released Marine Doom.When, three years later, 3D Realms released Duke Nukem 3D, a tongue-in-cheek science fiction shooter based on Ken Silverman's technologically similar Build engine, id Software had nearly finished Quake, its next-generation game, which mirrored Doom '​s success for much of the remainder of the 1990s and significantly reduced interest in its predecessor.In addition to the thrilling nature of the single-player game, the deathmatch mode was an important factor in the game's popularity. Doom was not the first first-person shooter with a deathmatch mode—Maze War was a multiplayer FPS in 1973, and by 1977 was running over ethernet on Xerox computers. However, the widespread distribution of PC systems and the violence and gore of Doom made deathmatching particularly attractive. Two-player multiplayer was also possible over a phone line by using a modem, or by linking two PCs with a null-modem cable. Due to its widespread distribution, Doom hence became the game that introduced deathmatching to a large audience and was also the first game to use the term \"deathmatch\".[citation needed]Although the popularity of the Doom games dropped with the release of more modern first-person shooters, the game had still retained a strong fan base that continues to this day by playing competitively and creating WADs, and Doom-related news is still tracked at multiple websites such as Doomworld. Interest in Doom was renewed in 1997, when the source code for the Doom engine was released (it was also placed under the GNU General Public License in 1999). Fans then began porting the game to various operating systems, even to previously unsupported platforms such as the Dreamcast. As for the PC, over 50 different Doom source ports have been developed. New features such as OpenGL rendering and scripting allow WADs to alter the gameplay more radically.[citation needed]Devoted players have spent years creating speedruns for Doom, competing for the quickest completion times and sharing knowledge about routes through the levels and how to exploit bugs in the Doom engine for shortcuts. Achievements include the completion of both Doom and Doom II on the difficulty setting \"Ultra-Violence\" in less than 30 minutes each. In addition, a few players have also managed to complete Doom II in a single run on the difficulty setting \"Nightmare!\", on which monsters are more aggressive, launch faster projectiles (or, in the case of the Pinky Demon, simply move faster), and respawn roughly 30 seconds after they have been killed (level designer John Romero characterized the idea of such a run as \"[just having to be] impossible\").[46] Movies of most of these runs are available from the COMPET-N website.[47]In 2011, a modification for Doom[48] was released with the intent of replicating the design style of the original game.","title":"Doom","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/57/Doom_cover_art.jpg","developer":"id Software","genre":"First-person shooter"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_Troopers","description":"Doom Trooper is a collectible card game designed by Bryan Winter.

The main character of those games is Son Goku.Since 1986, many video games based on the property have been released in Japan, with the majority of the games being produced by Bandai. Most of the fighting games from the 16-bit and 32-bit era were also localized and released in European countries like France, Spain and Portugal because of the strong following the series already had in those countries. Up until Dragon Ball GT: Final Bout, none of the Dragon Ball games were localized for the North American market, with the exception of Dragon Power (a version of the first Dragon Ball game for the Famicom that was graphically altered due to the lack of the license). Since 2002, Infogrames (now known as Atari) obtained the license to produce and release Dragon Ball games for the North American and international market.However, with the expiration of the Atari deal in 2009, Namco Bandai Games will assume the North American and European distribution rights, officially starting in 2010 (but really starting with the 2009 releases of Dragon Ball Z: Attack of the Saiyans on Nintendo DS, Dragon Ball: Raging Blast for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 and Dragon Ball: Revenge of King Piccolo on Wii).[1]Dragon Ball: Dragon Daihikyō (ドラゴンボール ドラゴン大秘境, Doragon Bōru: Dragon Daihikyō?, Dragon Ball: Dragon's Great Exploration)The first Dragon Ball video game ever produced.

The Japanese version of the game features a story mode that begins from the Frieza Saga and ends at the Buu Saga. The amount of life for characters is measured by a number system from 1 to 999, which can be charged at any time during the match. When the life reaches a level below 80, the characters are able to perform \"desperate moves\", which cause a large amount of damage. The characters fight on a multi-tier stage, which allows opponents to hit each other to other stages. The playable characters are Goku, Vegeta, Gohan, Perfect Cell, Piccolo, Veggito, Frieza, Fat Buu, Kid Buu, and Gotenks.Dragon Ball Z: The Legend, known as Dragon Ball Z: Idainaru Dragon Ball Densetsu (ドラゴンボールZ 偉大なるドラゴンボール伝説, Doragon Bōru Zetto Idainaru Doragon Bōru Densetsu?, Dragon Ball Z: The Greatest Dragon Ball Legend) in Japan, is a fighting game produced and released by Bandai on May 31, 1996 in Japan, released for the Sega Saturn and PlayStation.

In Europe, only the Sega Saturn version was released in France and Spain in late 1996, with the French edition retaining the original Japanese name and the Spanish edition being re-addressed as Dragon Ball Z: The Legend.The game utilizes a unique system of play that is different from most other fighters and the graphics feature 2-D sprites in a three dimensional world.Dragon Ball GT: Final Bout, known in Japan and Europe as Dragon Ball: Final Bout (ドラゴンボール ファイナルバウト, Doragon Bōru Fainaru Bauto?), is a fighting game for the PlayStation. It was produced and released by Bandai in Japan, parts of Europe, and North America in 1997. The game would reissued in Europe in 2002 and in North America in 2004. The game shares the distinction of being the first game in the series to be rendered in full 3D, and the last Dragon Ball game produced for the console. There would not be another new Dragon Ball game for consoles until the release of Dragon Ball Z: Budokai in 2002.The game is similar to other fighters but features 3D environments and characters from the Z and GT series of Dragon Ball franchise. Unique in the game were the special ki attacks called a Special Knockout Trick. These were the spectacular versions of the character's ki attacks the player performed at a distance. When these attacks are performed, the camera would cut and pan to the attacking character who would power up and the player would fire. During the attacking character's power up, the opposing character would be giving the opportunity to either retaliate or block upon the moment the word counter would flash on the lower right hand corner of the screen. If the player chose to retaliate, they too would power up and fire a ki attack causing a power crossfire which the camera would go around both characters à la bullet time. Depending on which player is pressing their button the fastest would determine who would receive the brunt of the blast. Another feature which was carried over from Legends, was a technique called Meteor Smash. With a key combo, players could ignite a chain of mêlée attacks.Released in Japan as Dragon Ball: World's Greatest Adventure (ドラゴンボール天下一大冒険, Doragon Bōru Tenka-ichi Dai-Bōken?)[9]Dragon Ball Z: Goku Hishōden (ドラゴンボールZ: 悟空 飛翔伝, Doragon Bōru Zetto: Gokū Hishōden?) is the first installment in the Goku RPG series, released on November 25, 1994.[citation needed] Despite the title, the game starts out during the end of Dragon Ball with Goku's fight with Piccolo at the World Martial Arts Tournament and ends with the battle against Vegeta in Dragon Ball Z.Dragon Ball Z: Goku Gekitōden (ドラゴンボールZ: 悟空激闘伝, Doragon Bōru Zetto: Gokū Gekitōden?) is the second installment in the Goku RPG series, released on August 25, 1995.[citation needed] It features five playable characters, as well as Goku's Super Saiyan transformation.

Released in Japan as Super Drakkhen (スーパードラッケン?) and otherwise known as Drakkhen II, it is meant to be a prequel to Drakkhen although it bears little resemblance to its predecessor. It uses the same pseudo-3D overworld system for which the series is most famous. Other features of Dragon View are its side-view action role-playing game (RPG) hybrid gameplay (used when exploring more detailed areas such as towns and dungeons), its well translated first person storyline, and its emphasis on player-driven undirected exploration.Most of the gameplay in Dragon View takes place through a side-view action RPG hybrid system. Action occurs on a widescreen display, with a large panel displaying character and enemy information taking up the lower third of the screen. A decorative bar at the top of the screen provides a buffer and helps to present the game in a cinematic light.Gameplay in this mode is reminiscent of Zelda II for the Nintendo Entertainment System. The character navigates various areas, exploring and fighting monsters in the traditional sense; an x plane (left and right motion) and y plane (jumping) control system. Movement through depth via z coordinates is also an important part of gameplay as it useful for evasion. While side-scrolling Action games in the past have used similar systems of movement (such as Final Fight), Dragon View is unique amongst them for blending this style in a medieval setting and with RPG elements.Dragon View does not limit the player to moving in any one direction through the game; the player is allowed (and is sometimes required) to backtrack through any area or dungeon, all the way back to the game's starting point. It is this structure that often teases players with upgrades to equipment and special items that they cannot reach until later in the game, after they have unlocked certain capabilities, at which point they may return and claim the upgrade.Many different types of such special items and upgrades are hidden throughout the world of Dragon View, Included are:The Drakkhen series' most recognizable feature is its custom overworld engine. First used by the original Amiga version of Drakkhen, it was later used in the PC and SNES ports. The Dragon View version sports basic terrain shading and mountainlike \"boundaries\" that enclose areas of the continent. The day/night cycle however is no longer present.","title":"Dragon View","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/d2/Dragon_View_Title_Screen.jpg","developer":"Atari Europe S.A.S.U.","genre":"Action role-playing game"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon%27s_Lair","description":"Dragon's Lair is a video game franchise that began with the laserdisc video game Dragon's Lair originally released for the arcades in 1983.Dragon's Lair also led to the creation of 1984's Space Ace, another game animated by Don Bluth and his crew. Space Ace was also a ROM and disc upgrade kit for the Dragon's Lair cabinets, complete with new control panel overlay, side art and header.Dirk the Daring is the main protagonist of the first game and subsequent franchise. He is a valiant knight of the kingdom, Dirk was entrusted with the rescue of Princess Daphne from the clutches of Mordroc and Singe because all other knights were killed. He becomes heir to the throne upon saving Princess Daphne; following her rescue, Dirk and Daphne were married. In the original Dragon's Lair, Dirk was voiced by the game's director. Retro Gamer included him on their list of top 50 game characters in the category \"Top Ten Forces of Good\" and called him \"without a doubt, the epitome of the heroic knight.\"[4]The game led to the creation of a short-lived television cartoon series, Dragon's Lair by Ruby-Spears Productions where Dirk the Daring was voiced by Bob Sarlatte and the unseen storyteller that narrates each episode is voiced by Clive Revill. Changes in the TV series included the originally nameless Dragon was given the name Singe (voiced by Arthur Burghardt), Princess Daphne (voiced by Ellen Gerstell) now wore a long pink dress, and included some exclusive characters like Princess Daphne's father King Ethelred (voiced by Fred Travalena), Dirk the Daring's horse Bertram (vocal effects provided by Peter Cullen), Dirk the Daring's squire Timothy (voiced by Michael Mish), and Dirk the Daring's rival Sir Hubert Blunt (voiced by Peter Cullen). Several enemies from the original game also make their appearance as adversaries, such as the Lizard King, the Phantom Knight, the Giddy Goons, and the Mudmen. Thirteen half-hour episodes were produced and aired on the ABC network from September 8, 1984, to April 27, 1985. It was last aired on the USA Cartoon Express between the late '80s and the early '90s. The show was generally run of the mill, but boasted an unusual feature: to keep the show in the spirit of the game, before each commercial break the storyteller would ask what the viewer would do to solve the problem facing Dirk. After the commercial break, the outcomes of the various choices were shown before Dirk acts on the correct idea (with the occasional exception) to save the day.A comic book miniseries based on the game, but incorporating elements from the cartoon series as well, like Dirk's horse Bertram, was released in 2003 by Crossgen Publishing, concurrent with a mini series based on Space Ace. Arcana Studio published the entire comic book series in 2006, as there were three issues that were never before published.","title":"","developer":"","genre":""},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drakkhen","description":"Drakkhen is a 3D role-playing video game which was initially developed for the Amiga and Atari ST, and subsequently ported to several other platforms, including MS-DOS and the Super Nintendo Entertainment System.Originally released by Infogrames in 1989, it was later modified for North American release by Draconian, a label from Data East, in 1990. Drakkhen was ported in 1991 to the Super Nintendo by Kemco-Seika, who made further revisions to the game.[1]Drakkhen was notable for being among the first role-playing games to feature a three-dimensional playing field. It did not employ a fully 3D game engine, instead implementing a hybrid approach using vectors and bitmapped character-scaling algorithms. Drakkhen features an animated day-night cycle, and the ability to wander freely about the game world, both rarities for a game of its era.The setting of Drakkhen is a large rectangular continent, divided laterally into four smaller regions. Each region features a unique terrain and climate, and is ruled over by two members of the elite Drakkhen caste, who all reside in their own keep. The continent is bounded on all sides by a vast ocean; walking into this, or any other body of water, will result in the speedy drowning of all of your party members.Much of the game is spent travelling between castles, carrying out various political missions at the behest of the ruling Drakkhen elite. A player may wander around without having a particular goal or destination, perhaps in the spirit of curiosity, adventure, or exploration, or to fight wildlife, monsters, and strange supernatural entities, who will yield loot and experience points if they are defeated. Serious setbacks can easily occur through the death of one or more party members in combat, and bringing them back to life will often involve difficult and arduous travel in order to reach an Anak, where healing and resurrections are performed pro bono. If all four characters succumb to injury or drowning, the player will be informed of the dire consequences for the game world, before being returned to the title screen.The storyline to Drakkhen lacked the complexity and pre-scripted dialogue commonly found in role-playing games of the time, and the plot was somewhat mystical and potentially confusing, which has been attributed to translation issues.Drakkhen is known for its unusual sound effects; in lieu of speech, monsters and NPCs make noises that resemble belching, chittering, retching, or inarticulate rumbling. Early releases made only limited use of music during gameplay, but the game's soundtrack was expanded for the SNES version.[2]A player may freely travel the length and breadth of Drakkhen's continent soon after beginning a new game, although this can be unwise in practice. Chance encounters with dangerous monsters are regular, and unlike many other RPGs, the player may be attacked while stationary. Players may attempt to flee from attacking monsters.Drakkhen attracted a modest cult following. The game was reviewed in 1990 in Dragon #160 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in \"The Role of Computers\" column. The reviewers gave the game 4½ out of 5 stars.[3] Computer Gaming World called the game \"an interesting idea but poor implementation\", criticizing pathing, documentation, and \"terrible\" character creation.[4]","title":"Drakkhen","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/de/Drakkhen_Coverart.png","developer":"Infogrames","genre":"Role-playing game"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dream_TV_(Super_Nintendo)","description":"Dream TV is an action video game for the Super Nintendo where the player has to guide two youngsters through a nightmarish land of evil television shows (using a similar plot to the campy movie Stay Tuned and Crystal Dynamics' video game Gex).

DM was developed and published by FTL Games for the Atari ST in 1987.[3] It reportedly sold 40,000 copies in its year of release alone,[4] and went on to become the ST's best selling product of all time.[citation needed]Dungeon Master was a realtime game in contrast to the traditional turn-based approach that was, in 1987, most common. Other factors in immersiveness were the use of sound effects to indicate when a creature was nearby, and (primitive) dynamic lighting. Abstract Dungeons and Dragons style experience points and levels were eschewed in favor of a system where the characters' skills were improved directly via using them. Dungeon Master was not the first game to introduce these features. Dungeons of Daggorath for the TRS-80 Color Computer first employed them in 1982. Dungeon Master was, however, responsible for popularizing these elements. Other features of Dungeon Master included allowing players to directly manipulate objects and the environment by clicking the mouse in the enlarged first-person view.[5] It also introduced some novel control methods including the spell casting system, which involved learning sequences of runes which represented the form and function of a spell's effect. For example, a fireball spell was created by mixing the fire symbol with the wing symbol. This kind of attention to detail and focus on the user interface was typical of the game and helped create an often captivating sense of craft and ingenuity.While many previous games such as Alternate Reality: The Dungeon, The Bard's Tale, Ultima and Wizardry offered Dungeons & Dragons-style role-playing, Dungeon Master established several new standards for role-playing video games and video games in general.[5]Many reviewers considered Dungeon Master as the best example of its genre, despite the many clones that arrived to challenge it. First of these was Bloodwych (1989), featuring similar gameplay but adding a mode allowing two simultaneous players on one machine. Other notable clones included Captive and Eye of the Beholder.Originally, Dungeon Master was started with the name Crystal Dragon. Doug Bell and Andy Jaros began development in their development studio PVC Dragon, before they joined in 1983 FTL Games.[1] It was finished there and published in 1987 for the Atari ST first. An almost identical Amiga version was released the following year, which was the first video game to use 3D sound effects. The game was also ported to PC, Apple IIGS, TurboGrafx-CD, SNES, Sharp X68000, PC-9801 and FM Towns and translated from English into German, French, Japanese, Chinese and Korean.While Dungeon Master itself was inspired by early Ultima games,[1] it was also itself the source of inspiration for the later Ultima Underworld game.[6] Game journalist Niko Nirvi wrote that no 3D role-playing title before Ultima Underworld (1992) could challenge Dungeon Master as a game.To date Dungeon Master retains a small but faithful following online, with several fan-made ports and remakes available or in development.[7]Dungeon Master received the Special Award for Artistic Achievement from Computer Gaming World when it was initially released.[8][9] It achieved the top place in the magazine's game rankings system,[10] and was entered into its hall of fame in November 1989.[11]Computer Gaming World in 1988 praised the attention to detail in the dungeons' graphics, allowing players to \"practically feel the damp chill of the dungeons portrayed\", as well as those of the monsters, including the multiple facial expressions on the ogres. The magazine said the control system works \"extremely well\" and \"one's adrenaline really flows because the game is in real-time.\" The reviewer also praised the extensive use of sound effects, uncommon to RPGs. He complained that the manual does not describe monsters or their attributes, of a \"frustrating\" shortage of food and water replenishments and that the lack of a map makes the game \"extremely difficult\". He called the game \"fantastic\" and said \"It is a welcome addition to any fantasy player's library. Those who want a good fantasy/role-playing game will love this one.\"[16] Another reviewer for the magazine stated in 1992 that the newly released IBM PC version's graphics \"are surprisingly good, all things considered\" despite the game's age, but wrote that \"No endgame has ever given me so much trouble or frustration\". Althogh the reviewer believed that the game \"is still eminently worth playing, even years later[, and] still has someting to offer the seasoned adventurer\", because of the endgame she \"can't give it a blanket recommendation\".[17] Computer and Video Games called the story a \"cliché\" but praised the graphics, sound and controls. The reviewer said Dungeon Master is an example of a title which \"changes the way we think about games\" and a \"must for all roleplayers\".[18]Advanced Computing Entertainment said the graphics are \"largely repetitive\" but \"wonderfully drawn\" and wrote the \"Sound is sparse but the effects are great.\" The reviewer called it a \"thrilling game with plenty in it to keep you searching, fighting and pondering for a long time.\" He summarised the game as a \"huge, immensely playable and very atmospheric mixture of role-playing and adventure. If you've been looking for a real-time role-playing game that manages to keep you interested for long periods of time, then your prayers have been answered.\"[19] The Games Machine wrote: \"the innovative character selection system and icon display are both neatly implemented and quick to use\", praised the \"superb\" atmosphere - enhanced by the spare but apt sound effects - and called the game universe \"believable because of its details\". The magazine praised the color and clarity of the monster graphics and the shading of the surroundings. It called the story and setting a \"wholly engrossing scenario [which] creates a complete world which can be manipulated at will: its depth fully reflects the two years it took to program it. The presentation - an interesting and evocative novella neither too involved to prove turbid not too short to be unhelpful - is superb.\" The reviewer summarised: \"Dungeon Master is a role-player's dream, but capable of providing a good deal of enjoyment for any ST owner.\"[20]Kati Hamza of Zzap!64 said of the Amiga version: \"The first-person perspective ensures an incredibly realistic atmosphere - you just can't help really getting into the feeling of walking through damp echoing caverns looking for ghosts.\" The reviewer also said: \"The puzzles are incredibly devious, the spell system is really flexible and the need to practise magic and spells gives the whole thing that extra-special depth.\" The reviewer asserted: \"This has to be the most amazing game of all-time, anywhere, ever\". In the same issue Gordon Houghton said: \"This is just about the most incredible game I've ever seen. When you pick it up you find you lose whole days of your life.\" He said: \"The best time to play it is late at night in a room by yourself - it's guaranteed to scare the life out of you. It's like Gauntlet in 3D, but about a hundred times better. If you enjoy arcade adventures, RPGs or combat games, but it: it's the perfect combination of all three.\" Reviewer Maff Evans professed to be little enthused by RPGs generally but said \"I know a brilliant game when I see one and this is a brilliant game.\" He praised the scares delivered by ambushing monsters and said \"you'd have to be deaf, dumb and blind not to be affected by the atmosphere\". The magazine complained that saving games is \"a bit laboured\" but praised the \"extremely detailed and accessible\" controls, \"interactive, detailed and extremely atmospheric\" scenery and said the clarity of the graphics made the game an unusually accessible RPG. It summarized: \"you'll be playing for months\" and said Dungeon Master was \"The best game we've ever seen\".[21]Also reviewing the Amiga version, Graham Kinsey of Amazing Computing wrote that Dungeon Master \"completely blows away any other RPG on the Amiga market today, and may do for some time\".[22] Dave Eriksson of Amiga Computing praised the \"brilliant\" graphics, sound effects and replay-value and said \"Dungeon Master is the most stunning role-playing game I have seen on the Amiga\".[23] Antic's Amiga Plus felt the game \"captures the essence of Dungeons & Dragons role-playing games\". The reviewer praised the \"dazzling\" graphics, called the user-friendly controls \"a real joy\" and said the game was the \"best graphics adventure for the Amiga to date.\"[24] Your Amiga called the sound \"extremely well done\" and said the \"most striking feature of the game is the attention to detail\". The reviewer said called the game \"amazing\" and recommended: \"If you never buy another game, by [sic] this one.\"[25]Andy Smith of Advanced Computing Entertainment several months after its release called Dungeon Master \"one of the all time classics\" and said \"What makes Dungeon Master really special (apart from the marvellous 3D graphics and eerie sound effects) are the puzzles\".[26] The game was reviewed in 1988 in Dragon #136 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in \"The Role of Computers\" column. The reviewers gave the game 4½ out of 5 stars.[27] The Lessers reviewed the PC/MS-DOS version in 1993 in Dragon #195, giving this version 5 stars.[28] In 1997, ten years after release, Dungeon Master got again a 5 from 5 stars score in a review.[29]The painting itself is 25 to 30 inches high and doesn’t contain the word \"Master\". Darrow’s painting portrays a scene from the prologue in the manual for Dungeon Master. It shows the three (or four) main characters' last few minutes alive, and is a portrayal of the player’s challenge to defeat the antagonist, Lord Chaos. The heroes in the painting are Halk the Barbarian, Syra Child of Nature, Alex Ander – and Nabi the Prophet who’s been reduced to a bunch of skulls.A soundtrack album, titled Dungeon Master: The Album, was released later.

Combining traditional platforming mechanics with experience and leveling mechanics originating from role playing games, E.V.O. involves the player navigating a creature through a number of side-scrolling levels while undergoing bodily evolution to cope with ever-changing environments. The game is heavily based on Almanic's original title 46 Okunen Monogatari: The Shinka Ron released exclusively in Japan in 1990 for the PC-9801 home computer.","title":"E.V.O.: Search for Eden","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/d9/E.V.O._-_Search_for_Eden_Coverart.png/250px-E.V.O._-_Search_for_Eden_Coverart.png","developer":"Almanic","genre":"Action role-playing game"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_Defense_Force","description":"","title":"[hide]","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/d1/Earth_Defense_Force_North_American_SNES_box_art.jpg/256px-Earth_Defense_Force_North_American_SNES_box_art.jpg","developer":"Jaleco","genre":"Scrolling shooter"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EarthBound","description":"EarthBound, known as Mother 2: Giygas Strikes Back (Japanese: マザー2 ギーグの逆襲, Hepburn: Mazā Tsu Gīgu no Gyakushū?) in Japan, is a 1994 Japanese role-playing video game co-developed by Ape and HAL Laboratory and published by Nintendo for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System video game console. As Ness and his party of four, the player travels the world to collect melodies en route to defeating the evil alien force Giygas. It is the second game of the Mother series, and the only one to be released in the English language. EarthBound was released August 27, 1994 in Japan, and June 5, 1995 in North America.EarthBound initially received poor critical response and sales in the United States, selling half as many copies as it sold in Japan. Critics credit this to a combination of the game's simple graphics, the satirical marketing campaign, and a lack of market interest in the genre. In the ensuing years, a dedicated fan community spawned which advocated for the series. Starting in 1999, Ness became a featured character in each of the Super Smash Bros. series of video games which furthered public perception of EarthBound. In 2013, EarthBound was reissued and given a worldwide release for the Wii U Virtual Console following many years of fan lobbying, marking its debut in many territories including Europe. Upon retrospection, the game received wide critical acclaim, and was deemed by many a timeless classic. A Japan-only sequel, Mother 3, was released for the Game Boy Advance in 2006.EarthBound features many traditional role-playing game elements: the player controls a party of characters who travel through the game's two-dimensional world composed of villages, cities, caves, and dungeons. Along the way, the player fights battles against enemies and the party receives experience points for victories.[1] If enough experience points are acquired, a character's level will increase. This increases the character's attributes, such as offense, defense, and the maximum hit points (HP) and psychic points (PP) of each character. Rather than using an overworld map screen like most console RPGs of its era, the world is entirely seamless, with no differentiation between towns and the outside world.[2] Another non-traditional element is the perspective used for the world. The game uses oblique projection, while most 2D RPGs use a \"top down\" view on a grid or an isometric perspective.[3]Unlike its predecessor, EarthBound does not use random encounters. When physical contact occurs between a character and an enemy, the screen dissolves into battle mode. In combat, characters and enemies possess a certain amount of hit points. Blows to an enemy reduce the amount of HP. Once an enemy's HP reaches zero, they are defeated. If a specific type of enemy is defeated, there is a chance that the character will receive an item after the battle. In battle, the player is allowed to choose specific actions for their characters. These actions can include attacking, healing, spying (reveals enemy weakness/strengths), mirroring (emulate a specific enemy), and running away. Characters can also use special PSI attacks that require psychic points (PP). Once each character is assigned a command, the characters and enemies perform their actions in a set order, determined by character speed. Whenever a character receives damage, the HP box gradually \"rolls\" down, similar to an odometer. This allows players an opportunity to heal the character or win the battle before the counter hits zero, after which the character is knocked unconscious.[a] If all characters are rendered unconscious, the game transitions to an endgame screen, asking if the player wants to continue. An affirmative response brings Ness, conscious, back to the last telephone he saved from, with half the money on his person at the time of his defeat, and with other party members showing as still unconscious. Because battles are not random, tactical advantages can be gained. If the player physically contacts an enemy from behind (indicated by a translucent green swirl which fills the screen), the player is given a first-strike priority. However, this also applies to enemies, who can also engage the party from behind (in this case, the swirl is red). Neutral priority is indicated by a gray swirl. Additionally, as Ness and his friends become stronger, battles with weaker enemies are eventually won automatically, forgoing the battle sequence, and weaker monsters will begin to flee from Ness and his friends rather than chase them.[1] While most RPGs up to the mid 1990s primarily used swords and other traditional weapons, the characters in EarthBound use less conventional weapons such as baseball bats, yo-yos, and frying pans, with the exception of Poo, who can actually use a sword. Likewise, healing items consist of various types of foods and drinks like cookies, hamburgers, and juices, while Poo has special healing items due to his upbringing and diet.The first Mother was released for the NES in 1989.[11] Its sequel, Mother 2, or EarthBound, was developed over five years[12] by Ape (later Creatures[13]) and HAL, and published through Nintendo.[14] The game was written and designed by Japanese author, musician, and advertiser Shigesato Itoi,[15] and produced by Satoru Iwata, who became Nintendo's president and CEO.[16] Mother 2 was made with a development team different from that of the original game,[17] and most of its members were unmarried and willing to work all night on the project.[18] Mother 2 '​s development took much longer than planned and came under repeated threat of cancellation.[12] Itoi has said that the project's dire straits were resolved when Iwata joined the team.[17] Ape's programming team had more members than HAL on the project. The HAL team (led by lead programmer Iwata) worked on the game programming, while the Ape team (led by lead programmer Kouji Malta) worked on specific data, such as the text and maps. They spent biweekly retreats together at the HAL office in view of Mount Fuji.[19]As was traditional for Nintendo, Mother 2 was developed in Japan and localized in the United States, a process in which the game is translated into English for Western audiences.[11] As the only game in the Mother series to be released in North America,[14] its title \"Mother 2\" was changed to \"EarthBound\" to avoid confusion about what it was a sequel to.[11]Under directives from Nintendo,[25] he worked with the Japanese artists and programmers[11] to remove references to intellectual property, religion, and alcohol from the American release, such as a truck's Coca-Cola logo, the red crosses on hospitals, and crosses on tombstones.[25] Alcohol became coffee, Ness was no longer nude in the Magicant area as seen in the image,[11] and the Happy Happyist blue cultists were made to look less like Ku Klux Klansmen.[25] The team was not concerned with music licensing issues and considered itself somewhat protected under the guise of parody.[11] Lindblom recalled that the music did not need many changes. The graphical fixes were not finished until March 1995, and the game was not fully playable until May. EarthBound was released on June 5, 1995 in North America.[25]Though Nintendo spent about $2 million on marketing,[15] the American release was ultimately viewed as unsuccessful within Nintendo.[25] The game's atypical marketing campaign was derived from the game's unusual humor. As part of Nintendo's larger \"Play It Loud\" campaign, EarthBound '​s \"this game stinks\" campaign included foul-smelling scratch and sniff advertisements.[24] 1UP.com called the scratch and sniff advertising campaign \"infamously ill-conceived\",[26] and Digital Trends described the campaign as \"bizarre\" and \"based around fart jokes\".[27] The campaign was also expensive. It emphasized magazine advertisements and had the extra cost of the strategy guide included with each game.[28] Aaron Linde of Shacknews wrote that the price of the packaged game curtailed sales.[24] Between the poor sales and the phasing out of the Super Nintendo, the game did not receive a European release.[15]Mother composers Keiichi Suzuki and Hirokazu Tanaka returned to make the EarthBound soundtrack, along with newcomers Hiroshi Kanazu and Toshiyuki Ueno.[29][30] In their transition to composing for a new console, Suzuki told Weekly Famitsu that the Super Nintendo afforded the team more creative freedom with its eight-channel ADPCM based SPC700, as opposed to the old Nintendo Entertainment System's restriction of five channels of basic waveforms. This entailed higher sound quality and music that sounds closer to his regular compositions. In Suzuki's songwriting process, he would first compose on a synthesizer before working with programmers to get it in the game. His personal pieces play when the player is walking about the map, out of battle. Suzuki's favorite piece is the music that plays while the player is on a bicycle, which he composed in advance of this job but found appropriate to include. He wrote over 100 pieces, but much of it was not included in the game.[31] The team wrote enough music as to fill eight megabits of the 24 megabit cartridge—about two compact discs.[12] The soundtrack was released by Sony Records on November 2, 1994, and was later reprinted by Sony Music Direct on February 18, 2004.[30]The soundtrack contains direct musical quotations of some classical and folk music; the composers also derived a few samples culled from other sources including commercial pop and rock music.[11][g] The texture of the work was partially influenced by some salsa, reggae, and dub music, wherein Tanaka cited influence from Andy Partridge of XTC's Take Away / The Lure of Salvage (1980), Lalo Rodriguez's Un Nuevo Despertar (1988) and Fireworks (1976), King Tubby/Yabby You's King Tubby's Prophesy of Dub (1976), and The Flying Lizards' The Secret Dub Life of The Flying Lizards (1995).[32] Speaking about Frank Zappa's Make a Jazz Noise Here (1991), he felt that Zappa would have been the best at creating a live performance of Mother music, but could not detail Zappa's specific influence on EarthBound. Additionally, he felt that the mix tape Wired Magazine Presents: Music Futurists (1999) presented a particular selection of artists which embody the ethos of EarthBound, running the gamut from space age composer Esquivel to avant-garde trumpeter Ben Neill, along with innovators Sun Ra, Steve Reich, Todd Rundgren, Brian Eno, and Can.[32][h] Miscellaneous influences on Suzuki and Tanaka for EarthBound include Michael Nyman, Miklós Rózsa's film score for The Lost Weekend (1948), Prince's Around the World in a Day (1985) and Sign o' the Times (1987), Godley & Creme's Consequences (1977), A Tribe Called Quest's People's Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm (1990), My Bloody Valentine's Loveless (1991), and the various artists compilation Stay Awake: Various Interpretations of Music from Vintage Disney Films (1988), the last of which Tanaka said he listened to heavily during EarthBound's development.[32]The game originally received little critical praise from the American press,[11][28] and sold poorly in the United States:[14][25][28] around 140,000 copies, as compared to twice as many in Japan.[24] Kotaku described EarthBound '​s 1995 American release as \"a dud\" and blamed the low sales on \"a bizarre marketing campaign\" and graphics \"cartoonish\" beyond the average taste of players.[11] The game was released when RPGs were not popular in the United States,[25][26] and visual taste in RPGs was closer to Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy VI. The game was especially expensive due to the included strategy guide.[25] While the game piggybacked on Itoi's celebrity in Japan, it became a \"curio\" for European audiences.[15]Of the original reviewers, Nicholas Dean Des Barres of DieHard GameFan wrote that EarthBound was not as impressive as Final Fantasy III, although just as fun.[40] He praised the game's humor[41] and wrote that the game completely defied his first impressions.[40] Des Barres wrote that \"past the graphics\", which were purposefully 8-bit for nostalgia, the game is not an \"entry level\" or a \"child's\" RPG, but \"highly intelligent\" and \"captivating\".[40] The Brazilian Super GamePower explained that those expecting a Dungeons and Dragons-style RPG will be disappointed by the childish visuals, which were unlike other 16-bit games.[42] They wrote that the American humor was too mature and that the gameplay was too immature, as if for beginners.[42]Reviewing the game years after its release, IGN's Scott Thompson wrote that EarthBound balances \"dark Lovecraftian apocalypse and silly lightheartedness\", and was just as interesting nearly a decade after its original release.[38] While he lamented a lack of \"visual feedback\" in battle animations, he felt the game had innovations that still feel \"smart and unique\": the rolling HP meter and lack of random battles.[38] Thompson also noted that technical issues like animation slowdown with multiple enemies on-screen went unfixed in the rerelease.[38] Official Nintendo Magazine '​s Parkin found the game to provide a more potent experience than developers with more resources and thought its battle sequences were \"sleek\".[15] Nintendo World Report '​s Justin Baker was surprised by the \"excellent\" battle system and controls, which he found to be underreported in other reviews despite their streamlined, grind-reducing convenience.[39] He wrote that some of the menu interactions were clunky.[39] GamesTM felt that the game was \"far from revolutionary\", compared to Final Fantasy VI and Chrono Trigger, and that its battle scenes were unexciting.[43] The magazine compared the game's \"chosen one\" story to a \"throwaway Link's Awakening/Goonies hybrid narrative\".[43] Reviewers praised Nintendo for digitizing the Player's Guide,[38] though IGN noted that it was technically easier to view it on another tablet rather than switching the Wii U's view mode.[38] The verdict among reviewers was that the game had aged well.[5][6][15][38][39]EarthBound was listed in 1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die, where Christian Donlan wrote that the game is \"name-checked by the video gaming cognoscenti more often than it's actually been played\".[46] Similarly, Eurogamer '​s Simon Parkin described it as a \"sacred cow amongst gaming's cognoscenti\".[47] Mott called the game \"utterly brilliant\" and praised its overworld and battle system.[46] Kotaku described aspects of the game's story, such as the \"Mr. Saturn coffee break\", as \"poignant\".[11] Jeremy Parish of USgamer called EarthBound \"the all-time champion\" of self-aware games that \"warp ... perceptions and boundaries\" and break the fourth wall, citing its frequent internal commentary about the medium and the final scenes where the player is directly addressed by the game.[48] He thought the final scene was \"perhaps the most clever and powerful moment in a clever and powerful game\".[48] David Sanchez of GameZone wrote that EarthBound \"went places no other game would\" in the 90s or even in the present day, including \"trolling\" the player \"before trolling was cool\".[6] Author Hiromi Kawakami told Itoi that she had played the game \"about 80 times\".[17] GamesTM said the game felt fresh because of its reliance on \"personal experiences\" made it \"exactly the sort of title that would thrive today as an indie hit\".[43] He called this accomplishment \"remarkable\" and credited Nintendo's commitment to the \"voices of creators\".[43] IGN's Nadia Oxford said that nearly two decades since the release, its final boss fight against Giygas continues to be \"one of the most epic video game standoffs of all time\" and noted its emotional impact.[7] Kotaku wrote that the game was content to make the player \"feel lonely\", and, overall, was special not for any individual aspect but for its method of using the video game medium to explore ideas impossible to explore in other media.[8]Critics consider EarthBound a \"classic\" or \"must-play\" among video games.[8] The game was included top 50 games of all time lists, including that of Famitsu readers in 2006[49] and IGN readers in 2005 and 2006.[50][51] IGN ranks the game 13th in its top 100 SNES games[14] and 26th among all games for its in-game world, which was \"distinct and unforgettable\" for its take on Americanism, unconventional settings, and 60s music.[44] And Gamasutra named it one of its 20 \"essential\" Japanese role-playing games.[52] The rerelease was Justin Haywald of GameSpot '​s game of the year,[53] and Nintendo Life '​s Virtual Console game of the year.[54] GameZone said it \"would be a great disservice\" to merely call EarthBound \"a gem\".[6] In the United Kingdom, where EarthBound had been previously unreleased, GamesTM noted how it had been \"anecdotally heralded as a retro classic\".[43] IGN's Scott Thompson said the game was \"the true definition of a classic\".[38]Several critics referred to the game as among their all-time favorites.[6][53][56] The game has been cited as an official influence on South Park: The Stick of Truth (via series creator Trey Parker),[55][57] LISA,[58] Kyoto Wild,[59] and Citizens of Earth.[60] Additionally, EarthBound has been reported as an unofficial influence on Contact.[48][61]EarthBound is known for having a cult following,[11][14][28][44][45][62] which developed over time well after its release.[25] Colin Campbell of Polygon wrote that \"few gaming communities are as passionate and active\" as EarthBound '​s,[16] and 1UP.com '​s Bob Mackey wrote that no game was as poised to have a cult following.[26] IGN's Lucas M. Thomas wrote in 2006 that EarthBound '​s \"persistent\", \"ambitious\", and \"religiously dedicated collective of hardcore fans\" would be among the first groups to influence Nintendo's decision-making through their purchasing power on Virtual Console.[45] Digital Trends's Anthony John Agnello wrote that \"no video game fans have suffered as much as EarthBound fans, and cited Nintendo's reluctance to release Mother series games in North America.[27] IGN described the series as neglected by Nintendo in North America for similar reasons.[45] Nintendo president Satoru Iwata later credited the community response on their online Miiverse social platform as leading to EarthBound '​s eventual rerelease on their Virtual Console platform.[63] EarthBound was hard to find before the rerelease.[8] In 2013, prices for the game's cartridge alone were more than twice its retail cost at its 1995 release.[25]Wired described the amount of EarthBound \"fan art, videos, and tributes on fan sites like EarthBound Central or Starmen.net\" as mountainous.[25] Reid Young of Starmen.net and Fangamer credits EarthBound '​s popularity to its \"labor of love\" nature, with a \"double-coat of thoughtfulness and care\" across all aspects of the game by a development team that appeared to love their work.[26] Young started the fansite that would become Starmen.net in 1997 while in middle school. It became \"the definitive fan community for EarthBound on the web\" and had \"almost inexplicable\" growth.[26] Shacknews described the site's collection of fan-made media as \"absolutely massive\".[24] It also provided a place to aggregate information on the Mother series and to coordinate fan actions.[24]The EarthBound fan community at Starmen.net coalesced with the intent to have Nintendo of America acknowledge the Mother series.[26] The community drafted several thousand-person petitions for specific English-language Mother series releases,[24] but in time, their request shifted to no demand at all, wanting only their interest to be recognized by Nintendo.[64] A 2007 campaign for a Mother 3 English localization led to the creation of a full-color, 270-page art book—The EarthBound Anthology—sent to Nintendo and press outlets as demonstration of consumer interest.[65] Shacknews called it more of a proposal than a collection of fan art, and \"the greatest gaming love letter ever created\".[24] Upon \"little\" response from Nintendo, they decided to localize the game themselves.[65] Starmen.net co-founder and professional game translator Clyde \"Tomato\" Mandelin led the project from its November 2006 announcement[24] to October 2008 finish.[66] They then printed a \"professional quality strategy guide\" through Fangamer, a video game merchandising site that spun off from Starmen.net.[65] The Verge cited the effort as proof of the fan base's dedication.[62]Other fan efforts include EarthBound, USA, a full-length documentary on Starmen.net and the fan community,[67] and Mother 4, a fan-produced sequel to the Mother series that went into production when Itoi definitively \"declared\" that he was done with the series.[68] After following the fan community from afar, Lindblom came out to fans in mid 2012 and the press became interested in his work.[16] He had planned a book about the game's development, release, and fandom before a reply from Nintendo discouraged him from pursuing the idea. He plans to continue to communicate directly with the community about the game's history.[16][i]EarthBound '​s Ness became widely known due to his later appearance in the Super Smash Bros. series.[14] He appeared in the original Super Smash Bros. and its sequels: Melee and Brawl.[69] Ness was among the biggest surprise inclusions in the original 1999 Super Smash Bros.,[70][j] which gave Mother series fans \"hope for the future\".[45] He was a hidden character and had odd controls, but was \"one of the most powerful characters\" when perfected.[70] His attacks were based on his psychic powers.[70] In Europe, which did not see an EarthBound release, he was better known for his role in the fighting game than his original role in the role-playing game.[69]He returned in the 2001 Melee with EarthBound '​s Mr. Saturn, which could be thrown at enemies and otherwise pushes items off the battlefield.[70] Melee also had an unlockable Fourside level based on the EarthBound location.[72] Ness was joined by Mother 3 '​s Lucas in Brawl.[73][74][k] Thomas East suggest in the The Official Nintendo Magazine blog that Ness should be removed from future versions of the fighting game due to his lack of popularity.[69] However, Ness returned as an unlock-able playable character in the 3DS version of the fourth game in the series, Super Smash Bros for 3DS and Wii U. He is a default fighter in the Wii U version, and is unlocked right from the start.A sequel to EarthBound was announced for the Nintendo 64 in 1996 as Mother 3[24] (EarthBound 64 in North America).[45] It was slated for release on the 64DD, an expansion peripheral for the Nintendo 64 that used a magneto-optical drive.[28] In development hell,[24] the game struggled to find a firm release date[77] and in 2000,[24] was later cancelled altogether when the 64DD flopped.[28]At the outset of the Wii's Virtual Console platform in 2006, IGN rated EarthBound as having a \"very high\" probability of a release on the digital distribution platform, adding that \"Nintendo is listening\".[45] Though the game was rated the most desired Virtual Console release in a Nintendo Power poll, rated for release by the ESRB,[80] and able to be published with little effort,[24] the Wii version did not materialize.[16] The game was commonly believed to be withheld from rerelease due to music licensing concerns,[11][l] and the Starmen.net community was told that \"undisclosed legal hangups\" were preventing the release.[24] English localizer Marcus Lindblom instead hypothesized that Nintendo did not realize the magnitude of the game's popular support and did not consider it a priority project.[11] In 2008, Nintendo removed the game's demo from the Masterpieces collection of the North American release of Super Smash Bros. Brawl.[24]At the end of 2012, Itoi announced that the rerelease was moving forward,[27] and a January 2013 Nintendo Direct presentation announced the Japanese rerelease for the Wii U Virtual Console as part of a celebration of anniversaries of the NES and Mother 2.[81] Following the Japanese March 20, 2013 release[39] and citing fan interest on Nintendo's Miiverse social platform, company president Satoru Iwata announced a North American and European release of EarthBound,[63] which was released July 18, 2013 alongside a digitized and free online version of the game's original Player's Guide.[82][m] The game was a \"top-seller\" on the Wii U Virtual Console. Kotaku users and first-time EarthBound players had an \"overwhelmingly positive\" response to the game.[11] Simon Parkin wrote that the game's rerelease was a \"momentous occasion\" as the return of \"one of Nintendo's few remaining lost classics\" after 20 years.[15] Media related to EarthBound at Wikimedia Commons","title":"EarthBound","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/1f/EarthBound_Box.jpg/250px-EarthBound_Box.jpg","developer":"Ape","genre":"Role-playing game"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthworm_Jim","description":"","title":"[hide]","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/08/Earthworm_Jim_%28EUR%29.PNG/256px-Earthworm_Jim_%28EUR%29.PNG","developer":"Shiny Entertainment","genre":"Platformer"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthworm_Jim_2","description":"Earthworm Jim 2 is a run and gun platform video game starring an earthworm named Jim in a robotic suit who battles evil.

It was published by Strategic Simulations, Inc. in 1991 [1][2] for the MS-DOS operating system and later ported to the Amiga, the Sega CD, Game Boy Advance and the SNES. The Sega CD version features an exclusive soundtrack composed by Yuzo Koshiro.[3] A port to the Atari Lynx handheld was developed by NuFX in 1993, but never officially released.The game had two sequels, Eye of the Beholder II: The Legend of Darkmoon, released in 1991, and Eye of the Beholder III: Assault on Myth Drannor, released in 1993. The third game, however, was not written by Westwood, who had been acquired by Virgin Interactive in 1992 and created the Lands of Lore series instead.Eye of the Beholder featured a first-person perspective in a three-dimensional dungeon,[4] similar to Dungeon Master.[5] The player controls four characters, initially, using a point-and-click interface to fight monsters.[4] This can be increased to a maximum of six characters, by resurrecting one or more of the dead NPCs bone remains or finding NPCs that are found throughout the dungeons.The possibility to increase the size of the player's party through the recruiting of NPCs was a tradition in all of the Eye of the Beholder series. It was also possible to import a party from Eye of the Beholder into The Legend of Darkmoon or from The Legend of Darkmoon into Assault on Myth Drannor; thus, a player could play through all three games with the same party.Eye of the Beholder II: The Legend of Darkmoon used a modified version of the first game's engine, added outdoor areas and greatly increased the amount of interaction the player had with their environment, along with substantially more 'roleplaying' aspects to the game.Eye of the Beholder III: Assault on Myth Drannor was not developed by Westwood Studios, the developer of Eye of the Beholder and The Legend of Darkmoon, but rather in-house by the publisher SSI. Despite employing an updated version of the engine, interesting and oft-unique NPC selection and welcome gameplay tweaks such as an 'All Attack' button and the ability to use polearms from second rank, it was not well received. Reviews criticized the oversized and maze-like maps, lag issues, unchallenging battles, poorly designed puzzles and uninteresting storyline.[citation needed]Eye of the Beholder Trilogy (1995, SSI) was a rerelease of all the three games for MS-DOS on CD-ROM. They also (as did a number of other AD&D DOS Games) appeared later in Gamefest: Forgotten Realms Classics (2001, Interplay).A game titled Dungeons & Dragons: Eye of the Beholder was released for the Game Boy Advance that uses a \"stripped down version of the 3rd edition D&D rules\" with \"only four basic character classes\".[6] It is not a port of the original game, though it possesses roughly the same plot. It bears stronger resemblance to the original Gold Box games, such as Pool of Radiance.Several modules for Neverwinter Nights have been created by fans as remakes of the original Eye of the Beholder game.[8]The original Eye of the Beholder game was reviewed in 1991 in Dragon #171 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in \"The Role of Computers\" column. The reviewers gave the game 5 out of 5 stars.[9] Dennis Owens of Computer Gaming World called it \"a stunning, brilliantly graphic and agonizingly tricky\" 3-D CRPG. The magazine stated that the game's VGA graphics and sound card audio finally gave IBM PC owners a Dungeon Master-like game.[5] Scorpia, another reviewer for the magazine, was less positive. Although also praising the graphics and audio, stating that they \"really give you the feeling of being in an actual dungeon\", she criticized the awkward spell user interface and the \"outrageous\" abrupt ending. Other areas that needed work, according to the reviewer, included the combat, plot, and NPC interaction; nonetheless, she was hopeful that with such improvements \"the Legend series will become one of the leaders in the CRPG field\".[10] According to GameSpy, despite the issues in the first Eye of the Beholder, \"most players found the game well worth the effort\".[11]GameSpy also commented that \"Eye of the Beholder III was a classic example of a company churning out a quick sequel to a good game and simply not giving it the love and care it really deserves\".[13] Computer Gaming World '​s Scorpia wrote of Eye of the Beholder III: Assault on Myth Drannor that since the game \"is the closeout of the EOB series, one would expect it to be on the spectacular side. Unfortunately, for several reasons, that isn't the case\". She stated that the graphics were inferior to the previous games', that \"Aurally, the game is a nightmare\", and that the \"big fight at the end is a letdown\", and concluded that \"Assault on Myth Drannor is a disappointment ... [it] just doesn't stack up agains the previous two games. What started as a series with great promise has, alas, ended on a mediocre note\".[14]","title":"Eye of the Beholder","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/2b/Eye_of_the_Beholder_I_PC_box.jpeg/250px-Eye_of_the_Beholder_I_PC_box.jpeg","developer":"Westwood Associates","genre":"Role-playing video game"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-Zero_(video_game)","description":"F-Zero (エフゼロ, Efu Zero?) is a futuristic racing video game developed by Nintendo EAD and published by Nintendo for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) . The game was released in Japan on November 21, 1990, in North America on August 23, 1991, and in Europe in 1992. F-Zero is the first game of the F-Zero series and was one of the two launch titles for the SNES in Japan, but was accompanied by additional initial titles in North America and Europe. It was re-released for the Virtual Console service on the Wii in late 2006, and Wii U in early 2013.The game takes place in the year 2560, where multi-billionaires with lethargic lifestyles created a new form of entertainment based on the Formula One races called \"F-Zero\". The player can choose between one of four characters in the game, each with their respective hovercar. The player then can race against computer controlled characters in fifteen tracks divided into three leagues.F-Zero is acknowledged by critics to be the game that set a standard for the racing genre and the creation of the futuristic sub-genre. Critics lauded F-Zero for its fast and challenging gameplay, variety of tracks, and extensive use of the graphical mode called \"Mode 7\". This graphics-rendering technique was an innovative technological achievement at the time that made racing games more realistic, the first of which was F-Zero. As a result, the title reinvigorated the genre and inspired the future creation of numerous racing games. In retrospective reviews of the game critics agreed that it should have used a multiplayer mode. F-Zero became part of the Player's Choice line by selling at least a million copies.F-Zero is a futuristic racing game where players compete in a high-speed racing tournament called \"F-Zero\". There are four F-Zero characters that have their own selectable hovercar along with its unique performance abilities.[8] The objective of the game is to beat opponents to the finish line while avoiding hazards such as slip zones and magnets that pull the vehicle off-center in an effort to make the player damage their vehicle or fall completely off the track. Each machine has a power meter, which serves as a measurement of the machine's durability; it decreases when the machine collides with land mines, the side of the track or another vehicle.[9] Energy can be replenished by driving over pit areas placed near the home straight or nearby.[10]A race in F-Zero consists of five laps around the track. The player must complete each lap in a successively higher place to avoid disqualification from the race. For each lap completed, the player is rewarded with an approximate four-second speed boost called the \"Super Jet\" and a number of points determined by place. An on-screen display will be shaded green to indicate that a boost can be used, however the player is limited to saving up to three at a time. If a certain amount of points are accumulated, an extra \"spare machine\" is acquired that gives the player another chance to retry the course.[9] Tracks may feature two methods for temporarily boosting speeds; jump plates launch vehicles into the air thus providing additional acceleration for those not at full speed and dash zones greatly increases the racer's speed on the ground.[10] F-Zero includes two modes of play. In the Grand Prix mode, the player chooses a league and races against other vehicles through each track in that league while avoiding disqualification. The Practice mode allows the player to practice seven of the courses from the Grand Prix mode.[9]F-Zero has a total of fifteen tracks divided into three leagues: Knight, Queen, and King. Difficulty is determined by the league selected and difficulty level chosen. The game has three initial difficulty levels: beginner, standard, and expert.[9] The master difficulty level is available for a given league once that league on the expert class is completed.[11] The multiple courses of Death Wind, Port Town, and Red Canyon have a pathway that is not accessible unless the player is on another iteration of those tracks, which then in turn closes the path previously available. Unlike most F-Zero games, there are three iterations of Mute City that shows it in either a day, evening, or night setting. In BS F-Zero 2, Mute City IV continued the theme with an early morning setting.F-Zero is set in the year 2560, when humanity's multiple encounters with alien life forms had resulted in the expansion of Earth's social framework. This led to commercial, technological and cultural interchanges between planets. The multi-billionaires who earned their wealth through intergalactic trade were mainly satisfied with their lifestyles, although most coveted more entertainment in their lives. This resulted in a new entertainment based on the Formula One races to be founded with vehicles that could hover one foot above the track. These Grand Prix races were soon named \"F-Zero\" after a rise in popularity of the races.[8][9] The game introduced the first set of F-Zero racers: Captain Falcon, Dr. Stewart, Pico, and Samurai Goroh.[8] IGN claimed Captain Falcon \"was thrust into the limelight\" in this game since he was the \"star character\".[12] An eight-page comic was included in its SNES manual that carried the reader through one of Captain Falcon's bounty missions.[13]The game was released alongside the SNES in Japan on November 21, 1990,[14] in North America on August 23, 1991,[A] and in Europe in 1992.[21] Only it and Super Mario World were initially available for the Japanese launch.[14] In North America, Super Mario World shipped with the console, and other initial titles included F-Zero, Pilotwings, SimCity, and Gradius III.[22] The game was produced by Shigeru Miyamoto.[23] The title was downloadable over the Nintendo Power peripheral in Japan[24] and was also released as a demo onto the Nintendo Super System in 1991.[25][26] Takaya Imamura, one of the art creators for the game, was surprised to be able to so freely design F-Zero's characters and courses as he wanted since it was his first game.[27]Mode 7 is a form of texture mapping available on the SNES which allows a raster graphical plane to be rotated and scaled freely, simulating 3D environments[6] without processing any polygons.[8] The Mode 7 rendering applied in F-Zero consists of a single-layer which is scaled and rotated around the vehicle.[28] This pseudo-3D capability of the SNES was designed to be represented by the game.[29] 1UP.com's Jeremy Parish stated it and Pilotwings \"existed almost entirely for the sake of showing [its 3D capabilities] off\" as they outclassed the competition.[22]An F-Zero jazz album was released on March 25, 1992 in Japan by Tokuma Japan Communications.[1][30] It features twelve songs from the game on a single disc composed by Yumiko Kanki and Naoto Ishida, and arranged by Robert Hill and Michiko Hill. The album also features Marc Russo (saxophones) of the Yellowjackets and Robben Ford (electric guitar).[1] The game was re-released for the Virtual Console service on the Wii in late 2006,[2] then on the Wii U in early 2013.[3][4][5]F-Zero became part of the Player's Choice line by selling at least a million copies.[citation needed] F-Zero was widely lauded by game critics for its graphical realism, and has been called the fastest and most fluid pseudo-3D racing game of its time.[6][36][37] This has been mostly credited to the development team's pervasive use of the \"Mode 7\" system.[38] Eurogamer's Tom Bramwell commented \"this abundance of Mode 7 was unheard of\" for the SNES.[39] This graphics-rendering technique was an innovative technological achievement at the time that made racing games more realistic, the first of which was F-Zero.[7][40] Jeremy Parish of Electronic Gaming Monthly wrote Mode 7 created the \"most convincing racetracks that had ever been seen on a home console\".[6] Parish said F-Zero used the SNES's technology \"to give console gamers an experience even more visceral than could be found in the arcades\".[6] 1UP.com editor Ravi Hiranand agreed arguing F-Zero '​s combination of fast-paced racing and free-range of motion were superior compared to that of previous home console games.[7] IGN's Peer Schneider assured readers F-Zero was one of the few 16-bit era video games to \"perfectly combine presentation and functionality to create a completely new gaming experience\".[28] The game was praised for its variety of tracks, and steady increase in difficulty.[28] GameSpy's Jason D'Aprile thought the game \"was something of a finesse racer. It took lots of practice, good memorization skills, and a rather fine sense of control.\"[41] Matt Taylor of The Virginian-Pilot commented that the game is more about \"reflexes than realism\", and it lacked the ability to save progress between races.[35] F-Zero '​s soundtrack was lauded.[28]In GameSpot's retrospective review by Greg Kasavin, he praised F-Zero '​s controls, longevity and track design. Kasavin felt the title offered exceptional gameplay, with \"a perfect balance of pick-up-and-play accessibility and sheer depth\".[33] Retrospective reviews agreed that the game should have used a multiplayer mode.[33][34][42] IGN's Lucas Thomas criticized the lack of a substantial plot and mentioned F-Zero \"doesn't have the same impact these days\" suggesting \"the sequels on GBA very much pick up where this title left off\".[34][43]F-Zero has been credited with being the game that set a standard for the racing genre[33][44] and inventing the \"futuristic racing\" sub-genre of video gaming.[42][45][46] IGN ranked it as the 91st best game ever in 2003, discussing its originality at time of release and as the 97th best game ever in 2005, describing it as still \"respected as one of the all-time top racers\".[46][47] ScrewAttack placed it as the 18th best SNES game.[48] F-Zero reinvigorated the racing genre inspiring the future creation of numerous racing games inside and out of the futuristic sub-genre, including the Wipeout series.[8][47] Amusement Vision's President, Toshihiro Nagoshi, stated in 2002 that F-Zero \"actually taught me what a game should be\" and that it served as an influence for him to create Daytona USA and other racing games.[27] Amusement Vision collaborated with Nintendo to develop F-Zero GX and AX, with Nagoshi serving as one of the co-producers for these games.[27][49]Nintendo initially developed the sequel of the first F-Zero game for the SNES, although it was broadcast in several versions on the St.GIGA subscription service for the Satellaview attachment of the Super Famicom instead.[28][34] Using this add-on, gamers could download titles via satellite and save it onto a flash ROM cartridge.[50] The sequel was released under the Japanese names of BS F-Zero Grand Prix[34] and BS F-Zero Grand Prix 2 during the mid-1990s.[51] There are tracks named as a follow-on from F-Zero—such as \"Mute City IV\", since Mute City I-III appeared in the original game. BS F-Zero Grand Prix contained a new track along with the original 15 tracks from the SNES game and four different playable vehicles.[52] According to Nintendo Power, the game was under consideration for a North American release via Game Pak.[52] IGN states BS F-Zero Grand Prix 2 features one new league containing five tracks, a Grand Prix and a Practice mode.[51]Although the F-Zero franchise made the transition to 3D graphics on the Nintendo 64 with the release of F-Zero X in 1998, Mode 7 graphical effects continued to be used for the Game Boy Advance (GBA) installments Maximum Velocity[37] and GP Legend.[53] The third sequel F-Zero: Maximum Velocity was released for the GBA in 2001. This installment was described by GameSpy as a hard overhaul of F-Zero and featured improvements to its graphical effects.[41][54] F-Zero GX and AX, were released for the Nintendo GameCube and the Triforce arcade system board respectively in 2003,[55] was the first significant video game collaboration between Nintendo and Sega.[56] GX is the first F-Zero game to include a story mode,[57] while AX was called by GameSpot as the first to get a \"proper arcade release\".[58] The most recent installment in the series – F-Zero Climax – was released for the GBA in 2004 and is the first F-Zero game to have a built-in track editor without the need for an expansion or add-on.[59]","title":"F-Zero","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/9b/SNES_F-Zero_boxart.jpg/260px-SNES_F-Zero_boxart.jpg","developer":"Nintendo EAD","genre":"Racing"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F1_Pole_Position_(video_game)","description":"","title":"F1 Pole Position\nHuman Grand Prix","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/d0/F1_Pole_Position_Cover.jpg/220px-F1_Pole_Position_Cover.jpg","developer":"[1]","genre":"Formula One"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F1_Pole_Position_2","description":"F1 Pole Position 2 - known in Japan as Human Grand Prix II (ヒューマングランプリ２?, lit. \"Human Grand Prix 2\") - is the sequel to Human Grand Prix and the prequel to Human Grand Prix III: F1 Triple Battle.","title":"F1 Pole Position 2","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/15/F1_Human_Grand_Prix_II.jpg/220px-F1_Human_Grand_Prix_II.jpg","developer":"Human Entertainment","genre":"Formula One"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F1_ROC:_Race_of_Champions","description":"","title":"Exhaust Heat\nF1 ROC: Race of Champions","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/bd/F1_ROC_-_Race_Of_Champions_Coverart.png/220px-F1_ROC_-_Race_Of_Champions_Coverart.png","developer":"Seta","genre":"Racing"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F1_ROC_II:_Race_of_Champions","description":"","title":"Exhaust Heat II\nF1 ROC II: Race of Champions","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/84/F1_ROC_II_-_Race_of_Champions_Coverart.png/220px-F1_ROC_II_-_Race_of_Champions_Coverart.png","developer":"SETA","genre":"Racing"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F1_World_Championship_Edition","description":"","title":"F1 / Formula One","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/01/F1_Coverart.png/220px-F1_Coverart.png","developer":"Lankhor","genre":"Racing"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faceball_2000","description":"MIDI Maze is an early first person shooter maze video game for the Atari ST developed by Xanth Software F/X, published by Hybrid Arts, and released around 1987.

The game constructed multiplayer networks using the MIDI interface. It has been suggested that MIDI Maze introduced the concept of deathmatch combat.[1]A prototype of MIDI Maze was found for the Atari 8-bit family.

Created by Brad Bird, the series was about an average suburban family, the Binsfords, as told through the eyes of their dog. It first appeared as an episode of the TV show Amazing Stories, then was expanded into a very short-lived series of its own.[3][4]In the original Amazing Stories episode, which aired in the show's second season in 1987, a dog (a Bull Terrier simply called \"the dog\") is the main character, portrayed in three stories: The first story involves general misadventures around the house, with him being both ignored and somewhat mistreated by his owners, originally named the Binfords. The second part is a \"home movie\" showing their Christmas (in which the family narrates), that culminates with the dog eating the ham. In the third, final and elongated segment of the episode, a couple of robbers break into the family's house twice (the first time was when the Binfords had to go out to see a movie at a movie theater, and the dog was given one more chance before the second time), so the father sends the dog to Gerta LaStrange's Dog Obedience School, so he can learn how to become a \"quivering, snarling, white-hot ball of canine terror\" in order to fend off the robbers. However, when they return to try to rob the house the third time, they run away from it to try avoid and escape from the dog, but when they return to their hideout, which is full of their stolen stuff (they came back with nothing from their third robbery), the second, shorter-bodied robber discovers the dog attached to his arm, with his teeth. Time passes, and the dog is still stuck to his arm. A policeman investigating the robberies approaches the door, burst in and the dog attacks him. The villains praise the dog, and decide to use him as a weapon in a crime spree (featuring the dog and his attacks and robberies). Later the robbers threaten to get a cat when the newspaper refers to them as \"The Dog Gang\". Already angered by this annoying humiliation, the dog becomes too much for the robbers to take, as he turns on them, causing an auto accident in which the robbers hit a cop car and are busted. The dog is returned to the Binford family, who now consider him their hero. The story ends with a catch-up gag, with the father stuck outside the house, as he tries to whisper to his wife to let him in. He then sneaks behind the house into the backyard, only to be attacked by the still-quivering, snarling, white-hot ball of canine terror.Written and directed by Brad Bird, with music by Danny Elfman and Steve Bartek, it was one of the most popular episodes of the Amblin/Universal Television weekly anthology television series, Amazing Stories.[5] The story was animated by Dan Jeup, Ralph Eggleston, Chris Buck, Sue Kroyer, Gregg Vanzo, David Cutler, Rob Minkoff, Alan Smart, and Darrell Rooney from an animation production design by Tim Burton. The animation production was outsourced to Hyperion Pictures (then under The Kushner-Locke Company), and was shot in Sydney, Australia by Cinemagic Animated Films, with Kim Humphries as camera operator.[6]The first half of the special was attached to another Spielberg-produced project, The Land Before Time, because of the film's short length of over-an-hour.[7]Spielberg's choice to make the episode using animation – especially combining the expense of high-quality animation with well-known voice actors – was considered risky and bold at the time. By the mid-1980s, animation was generally relegated to \"cartoons for kids\", with most animation (and virtually all animation for television) done as cheaply as possible, with low quality production. In retrospect, Family Dog is often considered to be a landmark production that, combined with Disney films like Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988), Oliver & Company (1988) and The Little Mermaid (1989), led to the Disney Renaissance, which had films such as Beauty and the Beast (1991), Aladdin (1992) and The Lion King (1994).Seven years after the success of the original Amazing Stories episode, a CBS series based on the episode was produced by Steven Spielberg and Tim Burton (who was involved in the original episodes contributing the story's production and character designs). It was written by Dennis Klein, Sherri Stoner and Paul Dini and animated by Nelvana, but notably lacking the involvement of the original writer and director, Brad Bird. Largely hyped due to the involvement of Spielberg, the series suffered various noted production delays that plagued the show. It did not get past its original network order of 13 episodes. Only 10 episodes were finished and sent back from the Wang Film Productions animation house in Taiwan but the producers were dissatisfied with the results, so they halted production on the final three episodes and outsourced the ten episodes to Nelvana for \"fixes and completions\".[2] The series was scheduled to debut on March 20, 1991 (and it was heavily promoted during the February 1991 broadcast of the Grammy Awards), but the animation production wasn't completed in time for this premiere, so the series was ultimately pushed back until 1993.[2][8] Frederick Coffin was originally cast as the voice of Skip Binsford, but Spielberg decided to replace him with Martin Mull, after animation was completed on the first three episodes.The series was part of a spate of attempts by major networks to develop prime time animated shows to compete with the surprise success of Fox's The Simpsons, alongside ABC's Capitol Critters and CBS's own Fish Police.[9] All three shows were canceled in their first season.When the show had finally debuted, it was roundly panned for its crude scripts and cheap production values, both of drastically lesser quality than the episode which had spawned the series.[1][10] [11] Brad Bird didn't participate in making the show because he did not believe the show's premise would work as a television show.[12] The entire series was later released as a Laserdisc box-set, and various episodes of the show were released on VHS around the same time. Universal, as of January 16, 2011, has yet to announce any plans for a DVD release.The show was later turned into a Super Nintendo game about the life of an everyday family dog. The player has to go three places such as the home where the dog lives, a dog pound and the woods to defeat stereotypical obstacles and enemies like dog catchers and cats.[13]","title":"","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fe/FamilyDog.jpg/250px-FamilyDog.jpg","developer":"","genre":""},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Feud#Home_versions","description":"Score Productions (1976–85, 1988–94, 2002–03, 2008–present)\nEdd Kalehoff (1994–95)\nJohn Lewis Parker (1999–present)ABC (1976–85)\nCBS (1988–93)\nSyndicated (1977–85, 1988–95, 1999–present)Family Feud is an American game show in which two families compete against each other in a contest to name the most popular responses to a survey question posed to 100 people. The show was created by Mark Goodson and Bill Todman in the United States, and now airs in numerous local formats worldwide.Since its premiere in 1976, Family Feud has aired during 32 non-consecutive seasons. The show premiered on ABC and was hosted by Richard Dawson until it was canceled in 1985, by which point it had been popular on both the network and in syndication. The series was revived by CBS in 1988 with Ray Combs hosting and aired until 1993. Combs also hosted its accompanying syndicated series until 1994, when he was replaced by Dawson. This series came to an end in 1995. The current series premiered in 1999 and has been hosted by Louie Anderson (1999–2002), Richard Karn (2002–06), and John O'Hurley (2006–10). Since the 2010–11 television season, Family Feud has been hosted by comedian/actor Steve Harvey.During Harvey's tenure as host, the show's ratings have improved significantly. During the 2011–12 season, the fast-rising game show averaged a 4.0 and became the 5th highest rated show in all of syndication (the show was previously averaging a 1.5 prior to Harvey's reign).[4] In 2013, TV Guide ranked it #3 in its list of the 60 greatest game shows ever.[5]Representatives of the family (contestants) are posed questions that have already been answered by a survey of 100 people, although the surveyed audience may sometimes be further narrowed down (e.g., \"100 women\", \"100 married men\", or \"100 single men\"). An answer is considered correct if it is one of the concealed answers on the game board or judged to be equivalent. More points are given for answers that have been given by more people in the survey, with one point per person; dollars were used instead of points prior to 1992 (see below for more information). Answers must be given by at least two of the 100 people surveyed to be included on the board, and a survey question must yield at least three (until 2003) or four (since 2003) total answers to be used on the show. There are five members on each team, except during the 1994–95 season, when each team consisted of four members.To start each round of the main game, two opposing family members \"face-off\" to see which family will gain control of that particular question. Traditionally, the contestants greet each other with a handshake before the question is read. Whoever guesses the more popular answer in the survey has the option to play the question or pass it to the other family opponents, except from 1988 to 1995, when they were automatically given control of the board. Players are also automatically given control if they guess the answer most commonly given, which is located in the top space of the survey board (referred to in the show's jargon as the \"Number One Answer\"). If both answers are worth the same number of points, control goes to the player that buzzed in first. If neither player gives a valid answer, the next member of each family provides an answer, with control again going to the family giving the more popular answer.Starting with the next family member in line, the family members take turns giving an answer to the host. Family members may not confer with one another while in control of the board. There is a time limit, with the host warning of a three-second count if time is short or the contestant appears to be stalling. An answer not on the board or a family member failing to provide an answer within the time limit results in a strike being charged to the family. When a family is able to reveal all the answers on the board before accumulating three strikes, they win the round and the bank.When a family in control accumulates three strikes, control passes to the other family, who then has one chance to steal the points in the bank by correctly guessing one of the remaining unrevealed answers. The family is allowed to confer before coming up with an answer, which then must be given by the team's captain. If the family guesses a remaining answer correctly, they receive the points accumulated by the other family. If unsuccessful, the opponents keep the points they scored during the round before three strikes. From 1992–95 and from 1999–03, the revealed answer's value was also added to the winning team's score.For the first six years of the 1988 Family Feud revival, conferring was not allowed. Instead, each team member was polled and asked for a response beginning with the anchor player and moving down the line to the captain, who had to decide whether to take one of the answers from his/her teammates or give another answer. This was similar to another Match Game mechanic used in the Audience Match portion of the Super Match bonus game, where a player would poll the panel for three potential responses and then either choose one or come up with one of their own. The rule was discarded once Dawson returned as host in September 1994 and conferring has been allowed ever since.After determining who takes the bank for a round, any remaining answers are then revealed. Per tradition, the audience yells each unrevealed answer in a choral response from lowest to highest.From 1992 to 1994 and in the 2009-10 season, the \"Bullseye\" round was played before the traditional gameplay began. One at a time and starting with the team captain, each member of the family went up to the podium to answer a survey question worth a dollar amount. Only the number one answer was accepted. Correctly guessing the number one answer added the value of that question to the family's bankroll.The Bullseye round first appeared on Family Feud Challenge where it was played in both halves of the hour-long show. In the first half, each family began with $2,500 as their starting bankroll. The first question was worth $500, the second $1,000, and so on up to $2,500 for the fifth question. The highest bank a family could play for was $10,000. In the second half hour, as well as on the syndicated series when the round was introduced, all of these values were doubled, with the starting bankroll at $5,000. The questions were worth $1,000 for the first, $2,000 for the second, and so on, up to $5,000 for the fifth. The highest potential bank was $20,000.The Bullseye round was revised as the \"Bankroll\" round for Dawson's return, and was played twice on each episode as the syndicated series was expanded to sixty minutes. Instead of each family member going up to answer a question, only one person on each team was required and the two contestants participated in all three questions. The starting bankroll in the first half was $2,500 and the question values were changed to $500−$1,500−$2,500, for a possible bank total of $7,000. These figures were doubled for the second half to $1,000−$3,000−$5,000, making the highest potential bank $14,000.The round was eliminated for Family Feud's revival in 1999, but was revived in September 2009 for the final O'Hurley season.[6] The starting bankroll was $15,000, with five questions in values from $1,000 to $5,000 in $1,000 increments. This format change only lasted one season.Questions are played for double and triple points toward the end of the game. Before 1992, families also received money in the amount of their score added to their winnings. The number of double- and triple-point questions in the game has varied over the years.1From 1999 to 2003, the leading family after round four automatically won the game regardless of their score, even though most families in this period reached 300 points. In addition, the controlling family was only given one strike for that round instead of three before the opposing family was given the chance to steal. This sometimes created an unusual situation in which a family could win even if the other family successfully made a steal if the answers revealed were not worth enough points. Other times when an opposing family already had more points than the bank, if a controlling family gave an incorrect answer, the game would automatically end. Also, if the two families were tied after the fourth round, a Sudden Death round, one Bullseye-type question, was given. Whoever answered it correctly wins the game.2The Sudden Death round is administered similar to the Bullseye round. The value is triple points, and if neither family reaches 300 after the Sudden Death round, another one-answer round is conducted.From March 2, 1983 through June 14, 1985, a tree of Tootsie Pops was placed next to the anchor player on each team. When it was introduced, the player chose a lollipop, and if it had a black stem the family won a $100 bonus, which did not affect the outcome of the game.The winning family plays Fast Money and chooses two family members to participate in the round. One family member leaves the stage and is placed in an isolation booth, while the other is given 20 seconds (15 seconds prior to 1994) to answer five questions. The clock begins counting down after the host finishes reading the first question. If the contestant cannot think of an answer to a question, he or she may pass and revisit a passed question at the end if time permits. If time runs out and all the questions have not been asked yet, they will still be in play as long as they have not been passed. The number of people giving each answer is revealed once all five answers are given or time has expired, whichever comes first. The player earns one point for each person that gave the same answer; at least two people must have given that answer for it to score. When revealing the number of people giving the same response, it is most commonly revealed with the phrase, \"[Our] survey said!\"Once all the points for the first player are tallied, the second family member comes back on stage with the first contestant's answers covered and is given 25 seconds (20 seconds before 1994) to answer the same five questions. If the second player gives the same answer as the first player on a question, a double buzzer will sound and the host will ask for another response, usually by telling the contestant, \"Try again.\"If one or both family members accumulate a total of 200 points or more, the family wins the top prize. If both family members score a total of less than 200 points, each point awards the family $5. Until 1992, the bonus for winning Fast Money was $5,000 on all daytime versions and $10,000 on all syndicated versions. From 1992 to 1995, the top prize was the amount accumulated in the Bullseye/Bankroll round (see above). The top prize reverted to $10,000 from 1999 to 2001, but was raised to $20,000 in 2001, an increase requested by host Louie Anderson because of inflation.[7] The top prize remained at that level until 2009, at which point the Bullseye round was reinstated, with a potential top prize of $30,000. The top prize reverted to $20,000 and the Bullseye round was removed at the beginning of the 2010–11 season. Since 2009,[6] five-time champion families also receive a new car.On the Gameshow Marathon episode (2006), the top prize was increased to $50,000 for a home viewer. On Celebrity Family Feud, the jackpot was $50,000 to the charity. If the goal was not reached, the $5/point rule was discarded and $25,000 was awarded to the charity instead.Family Feud was created during the increasing popularity of the Goodson-Todman game show, Match Game, which set daytime ratings records in 1976. Richard Dawson, one of Match Game's most popular panelists, was the immediate next choice as host of the spin-off, which combined the team format and form of questioning from the original 1960s Match Game with the survey polling used for the 1970s version's \"Audience Match\".Family Feud premiered on ABC's daytime lineup on July 12, 1976 at 1:30 PM Eastern, with Dawson as host and Gene Wood as announcer. Although it was not an immediate hit, ABC moved the series to 11:30 AM on April 25, 1977, where the series became a ratings winner and eventually surpassed the series it was spun off from, Match Game, to become the No. 1 game show in daytime.[8]The popularity of Family Feud in daytime inspired Goodson-Todman Productions to consider producing a nighttime edition, teaming-up with Viacom (through whom Goodson-Todman was already distributing a nighttime version of The Price Is Right) to launch that series on September 18, 1977 on local stations including those owned and operated by NBC. Like many other game shows at the time, the nighttime Feud aired once a week. Like its daytime counterpart, the nighttime Feud became a hit and expanded to twice weekly in January 1979.[9]Family Feud moved to 12:00 noon on June 30, 1980 after The $20,000 Pyramid was canceled, while reruns of The Love Boat filled the 11:00 AM hour. Later, in September of that year, the syndicated Feud went from being aired twice weekly to airing daily like the daytime series.By 1984, ratings for both editions of Feud had slipped from their peak due in part to changing viewing habits in both daytime and syndication. In October 1984, after over four years at noon, ABC moved the daytime Feud back to its previous 11:30 am timeslot and paired it with Trivia Trap, another Goodson production, to make up a game-centric hour and better compete with the lineups on CBS and NBC. The network did not get the ratings they desired from the hour (which saw another low-rated game show, All-Star Blitz, take over as Trivia Trap was quickly canceled) and ABC decided that they would not renew Feud at the end of the season in the spring. In January 1985, a cancellation notice for the syndicated edition came as well. On May 17, 1985, the syndicated Feud aired its final episode with very little indication to the home audience that it was indeed the finale; Dawson made a comment about the audience being \"too late\" when they greeted him with a standing ovation and he closed the show in a different manner than he normally did but there was no explicit statement.[9]The finale week of the daytime Feud began on June 10, 1985. Unlike on the syndicated series, the daytime series explicitly stated at the top of the Monday episode of the week that Feud was ending. Each day that week the impending end was noted at the beginning of the episode with some sort of commemoration, such as Dawson giving a total of all the money won across all of the series' run on the first episode of the week and Dawson being moved to tears by the ovation he received on the June 14, 1985 episode. At the end of the episode he gave an emotional farewell speech to the audience, and Gene Wood thanked Dawson and the nationwide audience during the fee plugs at the end of the half-hour.Three years after the original version ended, Family Feud returned to both daytime and syndication with stand-up comedian Ray Combs taking over for Dawson as host. On July 4, 1988,[10] CBS premiered the new Family Feud at 10:00 AM Eastern, replacing The $25,000 Pyramid. On September 19, the accompanying prime time syndicated series premiered. Both series were taped at Studio 33 (now known as \"The Bob Barker Studio\") at CBS Television City. On January 14, 1991, the show moved to the 10:30 AM time slot vacated by the daytime Wheel of Fortune (which moved back to its original network, NBC).On June 29, 1992, the daytime version, renamed Family Feud Challenge, added the Bullseye round.[11] This coincided with an expansion to a full hour, from 10:00 to 11:00 AM. The change in the format resulted in three families competing on each episode. Two families competed in the first half hour for the right to play the returning champions in the second half. Family Feud Challenge aired its final new episode on March 26, 1993, with reruns airing until September 10.[12]The syndicated series adopted the Bullseye round at the start of season five, but kept its half-hour format. The show also changed its name to The New Family Feud to coincide with this change.[citation needed]Although the daytime Feud was canceled by CBS, the syndicated series remained in production and was entering season six in September 1993. For the first time in its history Feud took its production on the road and recorded three weeks of celebrity specials at Opryland USA in Nashville, Tennessee to serve as the premiere episodes for the season. Following these the show returned to CBS Television City to resume taping. While this was going on, a shakeup at Mark Goodson Productions was in turn ready to cause one at Feud.Mark Goodson died on December 18, 1992, and his son Jonathan took control of his father's company.[citation needed] Although the syndicated Feud had been renewed for a sixth season, it had been struggling in the ratings for some time and Goodson was beginning to deal with an increasing number of cancellation threats from local stations.[13] Needing something to combat this and keep Feud on the air, the company began brainstorming for ideas to accomplish that.One of the ideas that was considered involved a change in host.[13] The belief was that if the producers replaced Combs with original host Richard Dawson, whom Goodson's father had clashed with during the previous series and who Mark Goodson refused to consider for the position in 1988, the ratings issues would be resolved.[13] Goodson agreed with the idea and offered Dawson, who outside of his 1987 appearance in the film The Running Man had largely retired, a chance to return to Feud which Dawson accepted. Combs was not happy with his dismissal after six years and following the final show of the 1993–94 season he immediately left the studio without saying goodbye to anyone.To prepare for Dawson's return, Family Feud underwent a large aesthetic overhaul. Gone were the families' name slider boards and living room scenery, the three-paneled game board, and most of the set pieces and lights. In order to create a more modern look and feel the entire set was covered with glass panels and a dark blue backdrop, which changed colors to red for the Fast Money round. The Ferranti-Packard board was used as the game board as well as for Fast Money, much in the same vein that the British Family Fortunes was doing at the time. A major difference, though, went hand in hand with the modern design idea put in place — for the home audience, a computer generated display was superimposed over the Ferranti-Packard board during the Bankroll round and the entire main game, with the Ferranti-Packard board only shown for Fast Money and the \"Family Feud\" display screen it usually was used to show.The team size was reduced to four for this season, and as noted above the Bullseye round was reworked to accommodate this, becoming known as the Bankroll round.[14] As the daytime version had earlier, the syndicated version expanded to sixty minutes in length from thirty, adopting the Family Feud Challenge format; however, affiliates were not required to carry both halves of the show. In addition, several families who had appeared on Feud when Dawson was originally hosting (1976–85) were invited back to play again. Dawson's return did not bring the higher ratings the producers desired and the syndicated Feud was finally canceled at the end of the 1994–95 season.After a four-year hiatus, Family Feud returned in syndication on September 20, 1999.[15] Dawson was offered the choice of returning to the hosting position, but turned it down and decided to have no further involvement with the show.[16] With Dawson's retirement, producers chose Louie Anderson[14] to host the new incarnation of the show over other leading candidate Dolly Parton. Burton Richardson became the new version's announcer.[17]Richard Karn was selected to take over for Anderson in season four on September 16, 2002.[18] The same game format was used, but returning champions were reintroduced and could appear up to five days. In mid-November,[19] two months after the start of the season, the retooled version of the show's theme song was replaced by the one previously used on the Combs version.In 2003, production moved to Stage 6 at Tribune Studios in Hollywood, California. Families again needed to accumulate 300 points to win, and the third round was worth double points. However, for all rounds worth triple points, Karn would not read the question again after the face-off. In addition, the Combs-era theme was replaced by the retooled theme and remained unchanged for the rest of Karn's run. At the end of season seven, Karn left the show and he was replaced by John O'Hurley. Pieces from the set were later sold on eBay.While the rules remained virtually the same for the O'Hurley run of the show, the set was completely overhauled as a throwback to the original Dawson set. This included the game board, logo and face-off and family podiums. The set was also the only one to feature audience in the round. The music used from 2006-08 was a remixed version of the Anderson / Karn theme, before reverting to the Combs' version for the 2008-09 season (which has remained since).On January 20, 2010, following the departure of O'Hurley and Richardson, comedian Steve Harvey was announced as the new host for season twelve[20] with former 'N Sync member Joey Fatone becoming the new announcer.[21] The show also moved taping locations to Universal Studios in Orlando, Florida.[22] The gameplay also returned to its 2003–09 format, although five-time champions still win a car as a bonus. The Fast Money jackpot reverted to a flat $20,000. Hometown family moments featuring members of the winning family sponsored by Comfort Inn & Suites were also added. These were dropped at the beginning of the 2012–13 season.After Harvey began hosting, ratings increased by as much as 40% from O'Hurley's last season as host.[23] Two years later, the show had jumped from a Nielsen rating of 1.5 (putting it in danger of cancellation) to 4.0, to become the fifth most popular syndicated program.[4]On May 7, 2011, announced via the show's official Twitter page, the show moved taping locations for the 2011–12 season to the Atlanta Civic Center in Atlanta, Georgia, where Harvey lives and hosts his radio show.On June 22, 2014, Harvey won the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Game Show Host for hosting Family Feud.[24]The show has been renewed through the 2016–17 season, and started airing in HD at the start of the 2012–13 season on September 10, 2012.[25] On standard-definition television broadcasts, the series continues to be displayed with the 4:3 aspect ratio.Family Feud regularly ranks in the top 10 highest rated programs in all of daytime television programming. In February 2014, the show achieved a 6.0 share in the Nielsen ratings, with approximately 8.8 million viewers.[26]Gabrielle Johnston, a Goodson-Todman staffer since the 1970s, is the show's executive producer, years after she was the show's Associate Producer of the 1980s version. Kristin Bjorklund and Brian Hawley are the current Supervising Producers, with Bjorklund also having been Associate Producer of the 1980s version.Previous staff members include Howard Felsher, the show's original producer before being an executive producer in the 1980s version, who was also a Goodson-Todman staffer since the 1960s, and Cathy Hughart Dawson, the show's original associate producer, who then became producer. Georgia Purcell assumed the associate producer role later in the series. Chester Feldman, who was a creative consultant for Goodson-Todman in the 1970s, was the show's executive producer in the 1980s version. Mark Dawson, Richard's son, was a writer and consultant on the show throughout much of his father's time as host.During the Dawson and Combs versions, Gene Wood was the regular announcer. On the 1976 Dawson versions, Johnny Gilbert and Rod Roddy substituted on different occasions. On the Combs versions, Roddy, Art James, and Charlie O'Donnell substituted. Burton Richardson was the announcer for all episodes from 1999 to 2010, except for the Gameshow Marathon finale episode in 2006, which was announced by Rich Fields. Joey Fatone has been the new announcer since the beginning of season twelve.[27]Family Feud was originally produced by Mark Goodson/Bill Todman Productions. Todman's name was dropped from the company after his death in 1979, and it was known as Mark Goodson Productions until 1995. The current version of the show used that name and logo from 1999 to 2002 even though the original production company no longer existed.The show's copyright holder was called \"The Family Company\" from 1976 to 1985, \"The New Family Company\" from 1988 to 1994, \"Mark Goodson Productions, L.P.\" from 1994 to 1995, and \"Feudin' Productions\" from 1999 to 2010. Family Feud's copyright holder is called \"Wanderlust Productions\". Since 2002, the show has been produced by RTL Group subsidiary FremantleMedia North America, as a successor to Mark Goodson Productions.Viacom Enterprises, now known as CBS Television Distribution, distributed the syndicated version from 1977 to 1985. From 1988 to 1995 and 1999 to 2002, it was distributed by FremantleMedia (previously under the names LBS Communications, All American Television, and Pearson Television). It was distributed by Tribune Entertainment from 2002 to 2007, when Lionsgate-owned Debmar-Mercury assumed distribution and 20th Television assumed ad sales.On the ABC daytime version, champion families could stay until they were defeated or reached or exceeded $25,000 in winnings (later increased to $35,000 during the show's final year). On the syndicated version from 1977 to 1985 and again from 1999 to 2002, two new families competed on each episode.The 1988–95 version featured returning champions, as has the current version since 2002. From 1988 to 1992 and again since 2002, the limit has been five appearances. From 1992 to 1995, champions continued until defeated. Since the 2009–10 season, families who retire undefeated also win a new car.The 1988–94 version carried special tournaments for the four highest winning families from certain periods of time returning for a Winner-Take-All Tournament of Champions. These were rarely held at first for both the CBS and syndicated versions.The main game rules applied, but if a family reached 200 points in Fast Money, $5,000 went into a jackpot that started at $25,000 and went up to potentially $55,000 on the CBS version. Likewise, on the syndicated version, the jackpot started at $50,000 and went up $10,000 for each time Fast Money was won, up to a possible $110,000. If the score was less than 200, nothing was added to the jackpot, as the $5 a point rule was discarded for the tournament. Each semifinal was the best-of-three games, with the first family in each one to win two games advancing to the finals, which was also a best-of-three match. There was no Fast Money round played during the finals. The scoring was similar to the 1984–85 season (single-single-single-single-double-triple) or the regular CBS/Syndicated version from late 1989 to 1990 (single-single-single-double-triple) in the finals, with the first family to reach 400 winning the game instead of 300. The first family to win two out of three games won everything in the jackpot in addition to what they won in the regular game.No additional tournaments were conducted on the syndicated version after season two. The CBS version continued conducting them, but in mid-1990, tournaments were held every month, with the top four money-winning families of the previous month returning. The main game point goals for winning a semifinal and a final game were the same, but the match format was changed from the best-of-three to a one-game match for both the semifinals and the finals. Thus, the potential maximum was lowered to $35,000.The current version began doing tournaments in 2002. The first occurred in May 2002 with the Family Circle Tournament of Champions, with eight winning families returning in a single-elimination tournament. The jackpot started at $50,000 and went up $20,000 for each time Fast Money was won, up to a possible $170,000. For this particular tournament only, if Fast Money was not won, $5 per point was added to the jackpot. Each game was played to 300 points except for the finals, which required 500 points to win the game and the jackpot. The winning team for this tournament won a trip to Charleston, South Carolina and tickets to the Family Circle Cup women's tennis tournament in nearby Daniel Island, in addition to the money, which was $112,230. The runners-up for this tournament won a trip to Jamaica.This version, however, did not do tournaments on an occasional basis until May 2005. Again, eight families were brought back, but this time, they consisted of either families who previously lost their first game for the tournament that was held in May 2005 and May 2006, or previously winning families, but not necessarily focusing on the higher winning families of the past for the tournament held in February 2006. The differences at this point for the tournaments were that the jackpot started with nothing, except for the February 2006 Tournament of Champions, which began at $10,000, for a possible $130,000. Losses in Fast Money did not add anything to the jackpot, as in the 1988–94 version and the championship game was played to 400 points. Trips were sometimes awarded to the jackpot-winning family, including Hawaii during the February 2006 tournament and Mexico during the May 2006 tournament. Again, no Fast Money was played in the finals.The tournament format did not return again until 2013, where the jackpot started at $40,000 and could get as high as $160,000.[28] This edition of the tournament was sponsored by Publishers Clearing House. As before, no Fast Money was played in the finals, and the first team to reach 400 points won the jackpot; the runners-up in this tournament received $20,000.During the week of Valentine's Day in February 1978, the Dawson daytime version ran its first all-celebrity week, which featured ABC soap stars competing. The success of this special week not only caused the show's ratings to peak, but also caused declining ratings of the network's soaps to increase. As a result, ABC created hour-long All-Star Family Feud Specials, which were played between cast members of hit prime time and, on rare occasions, daytime series for charity. The first installment aired on May 8, 1978 and did so well in the ratings that new specials continued to air as a semi-regular sweeps event on the network until May 25, 1984.In the first half of the special, two teams played until one reached $200 or more. That team went on to play Fast Money for $5,000 and competed in the finals against the team that won in the second half, which was played the same way. The two winning teams then faced each other in a one-question showdown, with the team that won the pot going on to play Fast Money for an additional $10,000.Originally, only the cast members of ABC series competed in the All-Star Specials, but when high ratings made it apparent that continuing to do so would soon exhaust the network's stable of celebrities, an agreement was reached with CBS, NBC, and the production companies, and stars of series from all three networks began appearing in the fall of 1979, similar to ABC's Battle of the Network Stars concept. At the time, networks did not own their own programming and had to rely on programming from the studios, who dealt with all three networks, and often, the battles were between shows from two different networks, even if it was the same production company.Underlying themes to the series' casts were occasionally featured, such as Nighttime vs. Daytime, featuring daytime soap stars competing against prime time TV stars, and some specials even removed the \"TV series cast\" format in favor of a single unifying theme among the four teams competing, such as Mutiny On The Love Boat, in which the cast of that show competed alongside such past guest stars as Robert Goulet, Jill St. John, Bert Parks and Rhonda Fleming.While technically a revival of the All-Star Family Feud Specials, this NBC prime-time summer series, entitled Celebrity Family Feud, premiered on June 24, 2008 as a six-week short series with Al Roker at the helm. This version featured teams composed of a celebrity captain and four friends or relatives, with a $50,000 charity payoff at stake. In addition, this version debuted set changes that were later introduced on the syndicated run for the 2008–09 season.This six-week miniseries was part of NBC's \"All-American Summer\", which also included America's Got Talent and MGM's revival of American Gladiators.The game format was similar to the All-Star Specials. The families played three rounds (single-single-triple-sudden death). The winners of the two games played in another three-round match for the right to play Fast Money.Family Feud Live! is a stage show held at the Foxwoods Resort & Casino in Connecticut with several hosts, including Michael Burger and Marc Summers. The shows are produced in association with RTL Group officials, including former television director Andrew Felsher, producer Cathy Dawson, and others who have worked on the TV version of Family Feud and other game shows. The show also briefly ran at two Atlantic City casinos in 2006.In 2013, a touring version of Family Feud Live! played fairs in the US and Canada, including the Calgary Stampede; actress and former talk show host Caroline Rhea hosted the 2013 edition, making her the first woman to host an official iteration of the game show. The format emulates the TV show, with two sets of contestants (usually unrelated audience members) going through the main portion of the game; following this, two additional audience members play Fast Money. Video footage of funny moments from the history of Family Feud and a brief history of the program is also shown.With the success of the Australian, UK, and U.S. versions, countries all over the world have attempted to emulate the success of these game shows. A summary of such attempts may be found at the article above.Since the show's premiere in 1976, many home versions of Family Feud have been released in various formats. Milton Bradley, Pressman Games, and Endless Games[29] have all released traditional board games based on the show, which have occasionally been given to contestants of the show. Tiger Electronics released two electronic handheld games in 1998 and 1999, which also included expansion cartridges. In 2004, Imagination Entertainment released a DVD game of Family Feud, a second edition in 2006, and a third edition in 2007,[30] with a movie edition of the DVD game also being released that same year.[31]The game has been released in other formats by multiple companies, with each company generally releasing a number of games over a period of years for different mediums (video game consoles, PC CD-ROMs, PC downloads, and mobile phones). Coleco Adam released the first computer version of the show in 1983, and Sharedata followed in 1987 with versions for MS-DOS, Commodore 64, and Apple II computers. GameTek released versions for NES, Super Nintendo Entertainment System, Sega Genesis, Panasonic 3DO, and PC (on CD-ROM) between 1990 and 1995. Hasbro Interactive released a version in 2000 for the PC and PlayStation.[32] In 2006, versions were released for PlayStation 2, Game Boy Advance, and PC.[33]Online versions appeared on Uproar.com and IWin.com. Seattle-based Mobliss Inc. also released a mobile version of Family Feud that was available on Sprint, Verizon, and Cingular.[34][35][36][37][38] Glu Mobile[39] released a newer mobile version of Family Feud for other carriers.In conjunction with Ludia, Ubisoft has released multiple versions of the series. The first of these was entitled Family Feud: 2010 Edition and was released for the Wii, Nintendo DS, and PC in September 2009.[40] Ubisoft then released Family Feud Decades the next year, which features sets and survey questions from television versions from all four decades the show has been on air.[41] A third game, entitled Family Feud: 2012 Edition was released for the Wii and Xbox 360 in 2011.[42]In addition to the home games, a DVD set titled All-Star Family Feud was released on January 8, 2008 and featured a total of 21 celebrity episodes from the original ABC/syndicated versions on its four discs. It was re-issued as The Best of All-Star Family Feud on February 2, 2010.","title":"","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/77/FamilyFeud2007Logo.png/240px-FamilyFeud2007Logo.png","developer":"","genre":""},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatal_Fury:_King_of_Fighters","description":"Fatal Fury: King of Fighters (餓狼伝説 ～宿命の闘い～, Garō Densetsu Shukumei no Tatakai?, \"Fatal Fury: The Battle of Destiny\") is a 1991 head-to-head fighting game released by SNK for the Neo Geo arcade and home platforms. Fatal Fury was SNK's first fighting game for the Neo Geo system and served as the inaugural game in their Fatal Fury series, as well as the first game to depict the fictional \"King of Fighters\" tournament (which became the basis for the later The King of Fighters games).

It is a sequel to Fatal Fury: King of Fighters and the second game in the Fatal Fury franchise. In North America, the video game was released for the Super NES and Sega Genesis in 1994.Fatal Fury 2 was the second game in SNK's 100-Mega Shock series, offering improved graphics and gameplay over the original Fatal Fury. The play controls were modified, this time making full use of the Neo-Geo's four button configuration, by including four attack buttons (Light Punch, Light Kick, Strong Punch, and Strong Kick). The player can also dash back from the opponent to retreat by quickly tapping the lever backwards twice.Other specialized techniques have been added as well. After the player guards an opponent's attack, they follow it up with a special counterattack technique known as an \"Evasion Attack\". The player can also taunt the opponent by pressing the Strong Punch button from a distance. Fatal Fury 2 also introduces the \"Desperation Move\" (or \"Fury\"), a powerful type of Special Move which causes massive damage that can only be used when the player's life gauge is at 25% and flashing red.Although the Neo Geo was a very popular console in Saudi Arabia in the early 1990s, with home cart sales exceeding 3,000 units a year, Fatal Fury 2 was the first game to be banned due to Mai Shiranui's revealing attire.[citation needed]In addition to the Neo-Geo AES and Neo-Geo CD home versions, ports of Fatal Fury 2 was released exclusively for the X68000 in Japan in 1993, followed by versions for the Sega Genesis, PC Engine Arcade CD-ROM² (Japan only), SNES and Game Boy in North America in early 1994. The SNES and Mega Drive/Genesis versions were published by Takara, while the X68000 version released only in Japan was published by Mahou Kabushikigaisha (Magical Company). All three versions allowed the player to control the four boss characters. The PAL Sega Mega Drive version, also released in 1994, is very rare and goes upwards of $200 on online auction sites. The PC Engine version was published by Hudson Soft in Japan only and was one of the first games to require the Arcade Card add-on. The Game Boy version is titled Nettou Garou Densetsu 2 (熱闘餓狼伝説２?, \"Dead Heat Fighters Legend of the Hungry Wolf 2\") and released exclusively in Japan on July 29, 1994. This port features \"super deformed\" style graphics and, like the SNES, Mega Drive/Genesis, and Sharp X68000 ports, allows the player to use the four boss characters. However, due to the Game Boy's limited hardware, all voices have been removed, but in their place the characters have speech bubbles when performing a special attack or Desperation Move. This port also features support for the Super Game Boy peripheral for the SNES. In the Game Boy version, the text in the intro, post match dialogue, and character endings are in Japanese, while the character names, game credits, and menus are in English.To coincide with the Japanese release of the SNES version, Hori Electric released a special SNES controller called the Fatal Fury 2 Commander. It has the power and super power moves of all the Fatal Fury 2 playable characters programmed in so that they can be triggered with a single button.[1]","title":"Fatal Fury 2","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f8/Fatal_Fury_2_%28cover%29.JPG","developer":"SNK","genre":"Fighting game"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatal_Fury_Special","description":"Fatal Fury Special (餓狼伝説SPECIAL, Garō Densetsu Special?, \"Legend of the Hungry Wolf Special\") is a 1993 head-to-head fighting game produced by SNK originally released for the Neo Geo arcade and home platforms.

While there was no major competition when EA released the first titles in their American football and hockey series, football video games such as Sensible Soccer, Kick Off and Match Day had been developed since the late 1980s and already competitive in the games market when EA Sports announced a football game as the next addition to their EA Sports label.When the series began in late 1993, it was notable for being the first to have an official licence from FIFA, the world governing body of football. The latest installments in the series contain many exclusively-licensed leagues including leagues and teams from around the world, including the German Bundesliga and 2. Bundesliga, English Premier League and Football League, Italian Serie A, Spanish La Liga, Portuguese Primeira Liga, French Ligue 1, Dutch Eredivisie, Brazilian Campeonato Brasileiro Série A, Mexican Liga MX, American Major League Soccer, South Korean K-League and Australian A-League, allowing the use of real leagues, clubs, and player names and likenesses within the games. In addition, internationally popular clubs from around the world, including some teams from Greece, Turkey, Argentina and South Africa, without those nations' entire leagues.The main series has been complemented by additional installments based on single major tournaments, such as the FIFA World Cup, UEFA European Football Championship, and UEFA Champions League, as well as a series of football management titles.As of FIFA 13, Lionel Messi is the face of the franchise, appearing on the front cover of every game released in the series and in promotional campaigns and advertisements. He replaced Wayne Rooney, who appeared on seven straight covers from FIFA 06 to FIFA 12.[1][2]As of 2011, the FIFA franchise has been localised into 18 languages and available in 51 countries.[3] The series has sold more than 100 million copies worldwide, making it the best-selling sports video game franchise in the world, and one of the best-selling video game franchises.[4] Also FIFA 12 holds the record for the \"fastest selling sports game ever\" with over 3.2 million games sold and over $186 million generated at retail in its first week of release.[5]The franchise's latest release is FIFA 15, released on September 23, 2014 in North America and September 25, 2014 in Europe for multiple gaming systems.While FIFA 95 did not add much other than the ability to play with club teams, FIFA 96 pushed the boundaries. For the first time with real player names by obtaining the FIFPro license, the PlayStation, PC, 32X and Sega Saturn versions used EA's \"Virtual Stadium\" engine, with 2D sprite players moving around a real-time 3D stadium. FIFA 97 improved on this with polygonal models for players and added an indoor soccer mode, but an early pinnacle was reached with FIFA: Road to World Cup 98. This version featured much improved graphics, a complete World Cup with qualifying rounds (including all national teams) and refined gameplay. Months later, World Cup 98, EA's first officially-licensed tournament game.FIFA games have been met with some minor criticism; such as improvements each game features over its predecessor. As the console market is expanding, FIFA is being challenged directly by other titles such as Konami's Pro Evolution Soccer series. Both FIFA and Pro Evolution Soccer have a large following but FIFA sales is rising as much as 23 percent year-on-year.[5] In 2010, the FIFA series had sold over 100 million copies making it the best-selling sports video game franchise in the world and the most profitable EA Sports title.[4][5] With FIFA 12 selling 3.2 million copies in the first week after its September 27 North American debut in 2011, EA Sports dubbed it \"the most successful launch in EA Sports history.\"[5]In 2012, EA Sports signed Lionel Messi to the FIFA franchise, luring him away from the competitor Pro Evolution Soccer. Messi's likeness was then immediately placed on the cover of FIFA Street. In 2013. the Spanish professional women's footballer Vero Boquete started a petition on Change.org, which called upon Electronic Arts to introduce female players in the FIFA series. The petition attracted 20,000 signatures in 24 hours.[6][7]Known as EA Soccer during development and sometimes subsequently also known as FIFA '94,[8] the first game in the series was released in the weeks leading up to Christmas 1993. This greatly hyped football title broke with traditional 16-bit era games by presenting an isometric view rather than the more usual top-down view (Kick Off), side view (European Club Soccer), or bird's-eye view (Sensible Soccer). It only includes national teams, and real player names are not used. A notorious bug allows the player to score by standing in front of the goalkeeper so that the ball rebounds off him into the net. The game was number one in the UK charts, replacing Street Fighter II Special Champion Edition, and staying there for a full six months.[9] Mega placed the game at #11 in their Top 50 Mega Drive Games of All Time.[10] The Sega Mega CD version was released under the title \"FIFA International Soccer Championship Edition\" it includes some features used in the next title, and is a highly polished version of the original. This version was ranked #7 on the Mega list of the Top 10 Mega CD Games of All Time.[10] The game on the 3DO console sported pseudo-3D cameras and it was the most graphically advanced version.[11] Also, the game is playable on the PlayStation 2 version of FIFA 06. It was made in celebration for the 1994 World Cup held in the United States - especially noticeable in the Super NES version which, despite having a smaller team selection than the Genesis version, had three exclusive teams which qualified for the real-life tournament: Bolivia, Saudi Arabia and South Korea. The game was called \"International Soccer\" so EA could sell the game successfully in Europe, after assuming Americans would have no interest in the game.[12]Using the same engine with only minor touch-ups, FIFA 95 introduced club teams to the series within eight national leagues: Brazil, Germany's Fußball-Bundesliga, Italy's Serie A, Spain's La Liga, England's Premier League, France's 1re division, Netherlands' Eredivisie and USA. Most of the leagues had their team lineup based on the 1993-94 season, and the teams, although recognisably real, all still had fictitious players, many of them even returning from the previous game. The USA League consists of teams and players from the A-League, the country's second division - subsequent editions would feature \"artificial\" division one leagues, a feature not corrected until the 2000 edition, when Major League Soccer was included for the first time. In addition, the Brazilian league contained only teams from São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, with the exception of Internacional, from Porto Alegre—it would not be until FIFA 07 that Campeonato Brasileiro represented the country. This was also the only game in the main series not to be released in more than one platform (counting spin-offs, only FIFA 64 and certain versions of the FIFA Manager series share this distinction).This is the first FIFA game to feature real-time 3D graphics on the Sega Saturn, PlayStation, and PC versions, using technology called \"Virtual Stadium\". It is also the first in the series to present players with real player names and positions, with ranking, transfer and team customisation tools. However, the Brazilian teams had mostly inaccurate rosters, some of them even featuring long-retired players (this would only be corrected in FIFA 99), and the American league consisted of entirely fictitious teams and rosters (Major League Soccer had been inaugurated for only a few months as of the game's release, but it would only start to appear in the games as of FIFA 2000). The SNES and Mega Drive versions use an updated version of FIFA 95's engine with new teams and graphics. It is also the first FIFA game to contain a player/team editor (in the Mega Drive and fifth-generation versions only). Also, in addition to the eight national leagues of the previous game, three leagues debuted in the game: Scottish Premier League, Allsvenskan and Super League Malaysia - a lineup that would stay for the next two editions as well. This was also the first FIFA game to have a proper introduction.The biggest change in FIFA '97 was the inclusion of 6-a-side indoor soccer mode and polygonal players, with motion capture provided by David Ginola. The game features a much higher number of playable leagues from England, Spain, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Germany and Malaysia. These versions also feature commentary by John Motson, partnered by Andy Gray, with Des Lynam introducing the matches.This game marks the start of an upward trend in the series. It boasts a refined graphics engine, team and player customisation options, 16 stadia, improved artificial intelligence, a \"Road to World Cup\" mode with all FIFA-registered national teams, and a licensed soundtrack featuring popular musical artists of the time. The game features many accurate team squads for national call up when playing in the round robin qualification modes. Another new feature was the ability to manually change the referee's strictness, allowing some fouls to go un-noticed or without punishment.Additionally, for the first time in a FIFA game, the offside rule is properly implemented. In previous games, when a player was in an offside position doing anything except running, that player was penalised for offside even when the ball was passed backwards. The 32-bit version of FIFA 98 corrects this so that the game would only award a free kick for offside if the ball was passed roughly to where the player in the offside position was.FIFA 98 was also the first of the series to feature a licenced soundtrack, with \"Song 2\" by Blur used as the intro track for the game. It was the last FIFA game to be released on the 16-bit consoles that the series had originated on.While the indoor mode was no longer featured, the gameplay's fluidity and responsiveness was increased. The increasing number of websites dedicated to the game and a larger number of leagues (the Malaysian league was removed, and on its stead came two new leagues: the Belgian First Division and the Portuguese Liga; this came to be a problem when the owners of the rights to the Primeira Liga tried to pull the game from the shelves locally). Graphically, it is a major improvement over FIFA '98, with the inclusion of basic facial animations and different players' heights as well as certain other cosmetic features such as improved kits and emblems, although they are unlicensed. Gamers may also create their own custom cups and leagues and select the teams they wish to participate.FIFA 99 also features an elite league called the \"European Dream League\" in which 20 top teams from across Europe battle it out in a league format. It was also the first game to feature a block containing teams which did not pertain to any of the main leagues (back then, it was known as \"Rest of Europe\" since all teams were European, the vast majority of them featured either in the 1998-99 season of the UEFA Cup or Champions League).The game was a bestseller in the UK, replacing Tomb Raider III.[13]This version of the FIFA series contained over 40 \"classic\" teams, so that gamers could play as retired football legends.It marked the introduction of Major League Soccer, replacing the fictitious \"American\" league previously included, as well as national leagues from Denmark, Greece, Israel, Norway and Turkey (though Galatasaray S.K. is not present in the game).The game features over 40 national sides, fully integrated seasons, set piece selections, increased physical contact, new facial animations, shielding ability and tougher tackling.The game received mixed reviews due to its cartoonish graphic engine and shallow gameplay, a brand new engine was implemented in an attempt to give more \"emotion\" to the 3d player models. The game was generally considered to be much inferior than its rival.The opening video for FIFA 2000 features Sol Campbell performing motion capture duties for the game, then having his likeness computer-generated to play against a retro side from 1994 - the year of the inauguration of FIFA. The game also included Port Vale, the club supported by Williams, in the \"Rest of the World\" section (they were in Football League 1 at the time, and while the concept of post-season promotion and relegation was introduced in this edition, teams from lower league tiers were only selectable starting with FIFA 2004).A Nintendo 64 beta version of FIFA 2000 exists though the game was not officially released for this platform.This title had a new graphics engine which allows each team to have its own detailed kit, and for some players, their own unique faces. Doing away with ordinary coloured pennants as club emblems, the license includes official club emblems for the first time, although certain leagues, like the Dutch league, are unlicensed. Slightly tweakable physics made the game a modding favorite for its fan community. The game also includes the entire Austrian Bundesliga as a playable league for the first time, albeit removing the Portuguese Liga and the Turkish Premier League. A \"hack\" feature is included, where the player can press R1 to attempt an intentional foul, such a high sliding tackle. This title was the first game of the series with a power bar for shooting (such a feature already existed in the Super NES version of the first game, but it was not in all versions of the game). FIFA 2001 was the first version (for the PC) that could be played online, which was revolutionary, and the first game in the franchise for PlayStation 2.For FIFA Football 2002, power bars for passes were introduced, and dribbling reduced in order to attain a higher challenge level. The power bar can also be customised to suit the gamer's preference. The game also includes club emblems for many more European clubs as well as for major Dutch clubs such as PSV, Ajax and Feyenoord, although there was no Dutch league of any kind (they were under the \"Rest of World\" header). This game also features, for the first time, the Swiss Super League, at the cost of excluding the Greek League. A card reward system licensed from Panini was also introduced where, after winning a particular competition, a star player card is unlocked. There is also a bonus game with the nations that had automatically qualified for the 2002 World Cup (France, Japan and South Korea), in which the player tries to improve the FIFA ranking of their chosen team by participating in international friendlies. Playing with other national teams will allow the player to play through their respective zones' qualifying rounds (except for Oceania and Africa, whose confederations are not represented in full).FIFA Football 2002 was the final game in the main series to feature the Japanese national team, as the Japan Football Association would sell its exclusive rights to Konami during 2002, thereby depriving not only FIFA, but all other football games in the market (with the exception of EA's World Cup spin-offs), from using its lineup and likeness (Japanese players in foreign markets continued to be featured in the series, though).FIFA Football 2003 added features completely new gameplay from the previous titles. EA revamped the outdated DirectX 7 graphics used in FIFA 2001 and 2002, and introduced new graphics featuring more detailed stadia, players, and kits. Club Championship Mode was introduced with the feature of playing against 17 of Europe's top clubs in their own stadia and the fans singing their unique chants and songs. A TV-style broadcast package gave highlights at half-time and full-time, as well as comprehensive analysis. One of the most anticipated new features was EA Sport's \"Freestyle Control\" which allows the user to flick the ball on and lay it off to team mates. Other additions include greater likenesses of players such as Thierry Henry and Ronaldinho, as well as realistic player responses. An Xbox version was added to the Windows and Playstation 2, whereas the original Playstation version was dropped. FIFA Football 2003 was also the first game in the series to use the EA Trax. EA Trax is the exclusive music menu system that has been used ever since in all FIFA titles.While not adding much to the game engine, the biggest new inclusion in FIFA Football 2004 is secondary divisions, which allow the player to take lower ranked teams into the top leagues and competitions (a promotion/relegation system was present since the 2000 edition, but none up until this one featured second-tier leagues). A new gameplay feature dubbed \"off the ball\" was introduced, which is the ability to simultaneously control two players, in order, for example, to move a second player into the box in anticipation of a pass. The online mode was touted as the main feature. Another key feature is \"Football Fusion\", which allows owners of both FIFA 2004 and Total Club Manager 2004 to play games from TCM in FIFA 2004. This is also the first FIFA game to feature Latin American club teams aside from those of the Brazilian League; there are four from Mexico (América, Toluca, Monterrey and UNAM; a fifth team, Tigres UANL, is present only in the Game Boy Advance version) and two from Argentina (Boca Juniors and River Plate). The title sequence, featuring Ronaldinho, Thierry Henry and Alessandro Del Piero was filmed at St James' Park, the home ground of Newcastle United.FIFA Football 2005 was released much earlier than the usual late October date to obtain a head start over Pro Evolution Soccer 4 and avoid clashing with EA Sports' own FIFA Street. The game features the return of the create-a-player mode, as well as an improved Career mode. The biggest difference compared to previous titles in the series is the inclusion of first-touch gameplay which provides gamers with the ability to perform \"real-life\" tricks and passes. It is also the first version to feature the full Mexican League. The game has no opening video, but its soundtrack is headlined by British DJ Paul Oakenfold, who composed the FIFA Theme especially for the game, using some sounds from the game such as crowd noises and commentary. This was the last title released for the original PlayStation in the US. The game also features authentic crowd chants edited by producer Dan Motut.FIFA's developers made a complete overhaul of the game engine for this installment of FIFA, claiming a dramatic increase in the control of play, having rewritten more than half the game's code. In addition to a renovation of the engine, which discards the \"off the ball\" system, the developers boasted a significantly more involved Career mode and the introduction of \"team chemistry\" which determines how well team members play together. This installment breaks with the long tradition of commentary from Match of the Day's John Motson and (more recently) Ally McCoist, who are replaced by ITV's Clive Tyldesley and former Sky Sports pundit Andy Gray, who had already worked in the series as guest commentator.One of the new features in FIFA 06 was a special \"retro\" which features nostalgia of the game. Inside it includes an unlockable classic biographies section, a memorable moments video compilation which features ten of the most memorable moments as judged by the FIFA 06 developers, a video compilation with a retrospective view of every game in the FIFA series and the chance to play the first ever game in the FIFA series which was titled as \"FIFA 94\". The game also features for the first time a Classic XI team consisting of great football legends and a World XI team consisting of current great superstars. Both teams have the Cardiff Millennium Stadium as their primary ground. These clubs must be unlocked in the \"Fan Shop\".The main differences from the previous game are a new \"Interactive Leagues\" function, new stadia such as the new Wembley Stadium and Emirates Stadium, and the ability to create custom teams and Turkcell Super League returns after seven years of absence from the series. The game's front-end and graphics engine remain largely the same. The Xbox 360 version uses a completely new game engine which was created from scratch for the system. This Xbox 360 version also features a much reduced team line-up, completely removing all lower division teams and focusing on the four main European leagues, plus the Mexican Clausura and national teams.FIFA 08 introduced a new game mode called \"Be a Pro\", in which the player controls only a single player on the field. This version also introduced a larger club section including the League of Ireland, and the Hyundai A-League of Australia, for the first time. Unlike FIFA 06 and 07 however, FIFA 08 does not include any memorable moments or season highlights. FIFA 08 does not have a version for the original Xbox, which means that FIFA 07 was the last game of the series to feature on the console. The Xbox 360 has taken over permanently since FIFA 08.It was the first game in the franchise for PlayStation 3. The debut version for the Wii introduced motion controls for shooting, as well as three mini-games that make use of the Wii Remote.FIFA 09 features a revamped collision system and an option for 10 versus 10 \"Be a Pro\" online matches, and the new \"Adidas Live Season\" feature, which updates all the players' stats in a particular league based on the player's form in real life. Although the feature is activated through microtransactions, gamers have access to one free league of their choice from the moment they activate the service to the end of the 2008-09 season. Online play has also been improved in FIFA 09, with a feature called \"FIFA 09 Clubs\" allowing players to form or join clubs and field their strongest team online. The game has met with generally positive reception from reviewers.Clive Tyldesley and Andy Gray again provide the commentary in the English version. However in the PS3 and Xbox 360 versions of the game, Tyldesley is replaced by Martin Tyler. For the first time, users can also purchase extra commentator voices in different languages from the PlayStation Store (PlayStation 3) and Xbox Live Marketplace (Xbox 360).[14] Another option for the English language is Tyldesley and Andy Townsend.FIFA 10 has an extended Manager Mode which includes a new Assistant Manager that can be used to take care of the team's line-up and to rotate the squad based on importance of the upcoming match and improved finances. The \"Player Experience and Growth System\" has changed. Player growth will now be determined by in-game performance, demands placed on the player, and achievements based on the player's particular position. The games also features 50 stadia and 31 leagues, among which the Russian Premier League is introduced to the series (except for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions). It also includes 360 degrees player control instead of the 8-direction control in previous games.FIFA 11 was released September 28, 2010 in North America and October 1, 2010 in Europe. It features a new replacement to Manager Mode called Career Mode; the player is able to play a career as a Manager, Player or a new feature as a Player Manager. Other new features include an improved passing system, improved player likenesses, the ability to play as a Goalkeeper for the first time, and other various other tweaks and additions. The English commentary is provided for the third time by Martin Tyler and Andy Gray. Landon Donovan, Kaká and Carlos Vela feature on the cover of the North American version of the game, while Kaká and Wayne Rooney feature on the cover of the UK and Irish version. Aside from Kaká and Rooney, Petr Čech and Andrés Iniesta are also prominently featured in the game, appearing in in-game screens like the menus of the PC version.David Rutter, the line producer for FIFA 12, has promised \"a revolutionary year for FIFA... especially in the gameplay department.\"[15] The first screenshot was revealed on April 11, featuring Brazilian midfielder Kaká running through the field.[16]FIFA 12 is the first edition of the series to feature Arabic commentary. The Czech Gambrinus Liga and Turkish Süper Lig are removed from the game (though Turkish side Galatasaray S.K. is still featured) and a third Argentine team, Racing Club de Avellaneda, is added to the Rest of World bracket. The Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3 were the main consoles for the game, and for the first time, the PC version was feature-identical. In May, EA announced that a Nintendo 3DS version would be available, including career mode, 11 vs 11, street mode and Be a Pro, but excluding any online mode. On 27 May, it was confirmed that FIFA 12 would be released on PlayStation 2. On June 7, it was confirmed that the iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch will also be included and others are to come in the next few months. On July 11, photos of the Career Mode were released.[17] During the demo launch on September 13, 2011, both FIFA 12 and Xbox Live were trending on social networking site Twitter. For the first time in the series, the game has been officially ported to the Mac OS X operating system by TransGaming Technologies.[18] In March 2012, FIFA Football was released as a launch title for the PS Vita, which despite the different name was a port of FIFA 12.On Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, the game is the first of the series compatible with Kinect and PlayStation Move, respectively. The game also features the Saudi Professional League, the first time Arabic football is represented in the series[20] (while FIFA 2000 did include club teams from the Arab World, it was generic teams with non-distinctive uniforms).New features include:For the newest generation of video game consoles PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, the game showcases a new engine, Ignite, which allows not only for graphical enhancements, like shifting weather conditions and dynamic environment, but also for changes in gameplay, with features like Human Intelligence (which brings the AI closer to real player behavior) and True Player Motion (which gives the players more realistic animations). Also, all versions have an all-new Co-op Seasons online mode, in which two players can play a season for the same team. As for the team selection, the game features, for the first time, the top leagues from Argentina, Chile and Colombia, the first time South American leagues other than the Brazilian one are featured in a FIFA game.\nThe PC version does not feature the Ignite engine (which will be exclusive to the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One releases); rather than that, they will feature the Impact engine, same as used in the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions (which the PC versions have been using since 11), with minor improvements. This is reportedly due to Electronic Arts' claims that most PC players do not own a machine powerful enough for the Ignite engine, therefore it would only be featured in the next edition.[28] This is the last FIFA game to be released for the Playstation 2. The game features new signature goal celebrations from a number of players including Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale, and Lionel Messi among others.[29]Outside the series, also from EA Sports:In 1997, Electronic Arts purchased the license from FIFA to publish official FIFA World Cup video games prior to each tournament and is still the current holder.Similar to FIFA World Cup games, in 2000, EA purchased the license from UEFA to publish official European Football Championship video games prior to each tournament and is still the current holder.FIFA Street is a spin-off franchise introduced in 2005 which focuses on flair, style and trickery, reflecting the cultures of street football and freestyle football played in the streets and backlots across the world.Since 1997, EA Sports have regularly released football management games, most of which have made use of their FIFA or FA Premier League licenses in their titles. The majority of these games were developed by EA themselves, though some have been developed by third parties such as Krisalis Software and Bright Future GmbH.Licenced music tracks were first used in the FIFA series with the release of FIFA: Road to World Cup 98, and have been used in every title since. The series has featured main themes from such successful acts as Kasabian, Muse, Linkin Park, Kings of Leon, Bloc Party, Oasis, Fatboy Slim, Blur, Robbie Williams, Duffy, Moby, Gorillaz, Paul van Dyk, Kraftklub and Tiësto and each game also contains a selection of tracks from contemporary album releases of the time, generally revolving around indie rock, electronica and world music.","title":"","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/02/FIFA_%28vg%29_font.png/150px-FIFA_%28vg%29_font.png","developer":"","genre":""},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_Soccer_96","description":"FIFA Soccer 96 (also known as FIFA 96: Virtual Soccer Stadium) is a video game developed by Extended Play Productions and released by EA Sports in 1995.

It was released for the PC on June 24, 1996 and versions for PlayStation, SNES, Mega Drive and Sega Saturn followed.FIFA 97 was the fourth game in the FIFA Series and the second to use the Virtual Stadium engine. Unlike the first game to use the engine, FIFA 97 features polygonal players as opposed to the 2D sprites used in FIFA Soccer '96. The engine however received complaints for being sluggish in the PC and PlayStation versions.The main new feature of the game other than the motion capture was the indoor football mode. There were six ways to play the game, including outdoor and indoor, as well as action and simulation modes. 32-bit AI was used, as well as motion blending technology which led to some of the sharpest graphics in any football game of the time. Here, it was possible to play six-a-side football in an indoor arena with the ball bouncing off the walls meaning there is no throw-ins and therefore a much higher paced game. Leagues available in the game included the English, French, Italian, German, Dutch, Scottish leagues and the Malaysian M-league and other sides, as well as the American A-League clubs with fictional teams, composed of the game's creators such as Bruce McMillan and Penny Lee. Commentary is provided by John Motson and Andy Gray while the presenter is Des Lynam. Multiplayer games are also possible with up to 20-players via LAN and 8-players using modem. The game trailer's tagline was \"FIFA 97, it will blow you away.\" Most European domestic leagues were featured in the game, including the English Premier League, but only teams from each nation's highest division were playable. The English clubs featured in the game were those who played in the 1995-96 Premier League. It was also possible to field custom teams made up of players from various real teams. However, these teams could only be played with in friendly matches.FIFA 97 features 10 songs which were made by EA Sports, the 10th song wasn't in the PC version and is a joke song containing lines such as \"He's got some funky stuff in the house\" and most bizarrely of all \"This reminds me of touring with The Sex Pistols.\"","title":"FIFA 97","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e9/FIFA97PCCDEurope.jpg/250px-FIFA97PCCDEurope.jpg","developer":"EA Canada","genre":"Sports"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA:_Road_to_World_Cup_98","description":"FIFA: Road to World Cup 98 (commonly abbreviated to FIFA 98) is an association football video game developed by EA Canada and published by Electronic Arts.

The original Fighter's History was first released for the arcades in 1993 and then ported to the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in 1994. Two different sequels were produced: Fighter's History Dynamite (ファイターズヒストリーダイナマイト, Faitāzu Hisutorī Dainamaito?), known in Europe as Karnov's Revenge, for the Neo Geo in 1994, followed by Fighter's History: Mizoguchi Kiki Ippatsu!! (ファイターズヒストリー 〜溝口危機一髪!!〜, Faitāzu Hisutorī: Mizoguchi Kiki Ippatsu!!?, \"Mizoguchi's Moment of Crisis!!\"), released exclusively in Japan for the Super Famicom in 1995.The main unique feature of the Fighter's History series is its \"weak point system\". By repeatedly hitting an opponent's weak point, the player can temporarily stun them once per round, leaving the opponent open for an attack. The location of an opponent's weak spot varies with each character and is usually represented by a specific article of clothing (i.e.: a headband, a vest, a mask).The original Fighter's History was first released as an arcade game in March 1993. The game uses a six-button control configuration similar to Street Fighter II and its iterations, as well as an alternate version of the first Street Fighter, with three punch buttons and three kick buttons, each for different strength levels (light, medium, and heavy). There are a total of nine playable characters, as well as two non-playable boss characters at the end of the single-player tournament. The final boss and sponsor of the tournament is revealed to be Karnov, the protagonist of the Data East action game of the same name.In this installment hitting an opponent's weak point will not only stun the opponent, it will also cause the opponent to sustain greater damage when the weak point is repeatedly struck afterward.The game was ported to the Super Famicom in Japan on May 27, 1994, and for its American counterpart, the Super NES, on August of the same year. The two boss characters, Karnov and Clown, are both playable in the home version through the use of a code.Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the SNES version a 6.75 out of 10. They commented that the graphics are average, but highly praised the controls as exceptional for a fighting game.[1] GamePro gave the SNES version a negative review, calling the game \"an unremarkable SF knock-off with solid but slow game play\", and heavily criticizing the \"bland\" character design.[2]Fighter's History Dynamite, also titled Karnov's Revenge in certain markets, was released for the arcades March 17, 1994. Due to change of hardware to SNK's MVS platform, the control configuration was reduced from six attack buttons to just four (only light and heavy attacks are available this time). Likewise, the game was released for the Neo Geo home console, as well as the Neo Geo CD, on April 28, 1994.A new gameplay feature is introduced in the form of \"one-two attacks\". When the player presses a heavy attack button while performing a light attack or blocking, the interval between light attacks is reduced, making combos easier to perform. While this feature is not mentioned on the instruction card, the final page of the home Neo-Geo version's manual mentions it, describing as the \"one-two attack\" system.All eleven fighters from the previous game return (including the bosses Clown and Karnov, who are now playable) and are joined by two new characters: Yungmie, a female taekwondo exponent from Korea, and Zazie, a karate practitioner from Kenya, for a total of 13 characters. Karnov is the only returning character who was given entirely new sprites. Most of the returning characters were given new special techniques (with a few exceptions), including hidden techniques which are not listed on the instruction card (the manual for the home version hints of their inclusion). The Ox that appeared in the bonus rounds in Karate Champ appears in this game as a secret boss if the player completes the game on the Normal setting or above without losing a round. The Ox is an unplayable character.On release, Famicom Tsūshin scored the Neo Geo version of the game a 25 out of 40.[3] GamePro rated it as a modest improvement over the first game, with faster paced action but the same lack of likeable characters. However, they said the new characters are better than the old ones, especially Yungmie and her unique trait of using only her legs to attack.[4] In addition to the ports for the Neo Geo home consoles, Fighter's History Dynamite was released for the Sega Saturn exclusively in Japan on July 4, 1997. The Saturn version allows players to assign all four basic attacks into a single button (C and Z by default), which is required for certain characters in order to perform certain special moves. A Virtual Console reissue of the Neo Geo version was released for the Wii in Japan on June 8, 2010 and in North America on December 27, 2010. It was also added to Zeebo on April 23, 2010.Fighter's History: Mizoguchi Kiki Ippatsu!! (\"Mizoguchi's Moment of Crisis!!\") was released exclusively in Japan for the Super Famicom on February 17, 1995. It was the only game in the series released exclusively for the home market. Originally planned as a port of Fighter's History Dynamite, many changes were made to the game, including the addition of a new game mode where Mizoguchi is the protagonist. The story takes place after the events of Dynamite. In addition to the story-based Mizoguchi Mode, there are also three new game modes (Practice, Tag Battle, and Survival) in addition to the traditional CPU Battle and 2-Player Versus Modes.There are only nine playable characters in this installment, as five of the characters from the previous Fighter's History games were cut from the roster (Ray, Jean, Matlock, Samchay, and Marstorius). Chelnov, the main character from Data East's arcade game Atomic Runner Chelnov, appears in this game as the final boss, as well as a hidden character playable via a code. Ray, Jean, Matlock, Samchay and Marstorius, while not playable, appear during the story sequences of the Mizoguchi Mode.Like the Saturn version of Dynamite, the player can assign all four basic attacks into a single button (R by default). The Practice Mode is actually a tutorial that teaches players how to perform various combos with each character. By completing all of the exercises given, the player will be taught how to perform a new special technique for their character.On release, Famitsu magazine scored Mizoguchi Kiki Ippatsu a 25 out of 40.[5]At the time of the first game's release, Capcom U.S.A. sued Data East Corp. over Fighter's History due to what Capcom U.S.A. felt were infringements on its Street Fighter II property. Capcom also filed similar claims against Data East in Japan.[6] Data East Corp.'s largest objection in court was that their 1984 arcade game Karate Champ was the true originator of the competitive fighting game genre, which predated the original Street Fighter by three years.[7] Judge Orrick set an October 31, 1994 trial date, stating that he could not deny \"the strong evidence that it set out to copy Street Fighter's success,\" noting similarities such as a Chun-Li clone and several comparable special moves.[6] However, Capcom U.S.A. lost the case on grounds that the copied elements were scenes a faire and thus excluded from copyright.[8]All three titles in the series had their soundtracks published the CD albums exclusively in Japan. On June 18, 1993, the original arcade version of the original Fighter's History soundtrack was released by Pony Canyon and Scitron Label, while the SNES version's soundtrack was released by Project EGG on July 19, 2011, which can be downloaded on the official Project EGG website. On March 18, 1994, the soundtrack of the Neo-Geo MVS / Neo-Geo AES version of Fighter's History Dynamite / Karnov's Revenge was added with the Neo-Geo MVS / Neo-Geo AES soundtrack of Windjammers (known in Japan as Flying Power Disc) by Pony Canyon and Scitron Label in an album titled Fighter's History Dynamite / Flying Power Disc. This album features two exclusive arranged versions of \"DYNAMITE\" (from Fighter's History Dynamite / Karnov's Revenge) (Arrange Version begins) and \"SHOOOT!!\" (from Windjammers / Flying Power Disc). On July 26, 2011, Project EGG published the soundtrack of the Neo-Geo MVS / Neo-Geo AES version of Fighter's History Dynamite / Karnov's Revenge alone without the arranged version of \"DYNAMITE\", which like their other soundtrack, also can be downloaded on the official Project EGG website. On August 26, 2005, Insanity Naked Hunter Co., Ltd. published the same version Project EGG published, but exclusively as a CD album. On March 19, 1995, Pony Canyon and Scitron Label published the soundtracks of the Neo-Geo CD version of Fighter's History Dynamite / Karnov's Revenge and Fighter's History: Mizoguchi Kiki Ippatsu!! both in the album titled Fighter's History Dynamite NEO-GEO CD & Mizoguchi Kiki Ippatsu!!.Outside of the Fighter's History series, Makoto Mizoguchi became prominent when he appeared in several other video games. He appeared in the Sega Saturn and Sony PlayStation versions of Data East's 1995 Water Margin-based fighting arcade game, Outlaws Of The Lost Dynasty as an extra character. The Sega Saturn version is known outside of Japan as Dark Legend. He and Liu Yungmie later appeared in its Japan-exclusive semi-sequel, titled as Suiko Enbu: Fuuun Saiki. Five years after Data East went out of business while giving their video game rights to G-Mode, Paon, WorkJam and Crea-tech, SNK Playmore signed a deal with G-Mode to use their characters from the Fighter's History series in two SNK Playmore titles.[9] Makoto Mizoguchi became the only character from the Fighter's History series as a special guest character in an upgrade to KOF: Maximum Impact 2 titled as KOF: Maximum Impact Regulation A, to promote the Japan-exclusive cell phone game specifically featuring the cast of Fatal Fury Special and Fighter's History Dynamite titled as Garou Densetsu vs. Fighter's History Dynamite.[10] Makoto Mizoguchi also appeared in Joe & Mac Returns as one of the enemies in the game, and as a hidden character in Kenka Bancho: Badass Rumble.In the 1998 movie The Replacement Killers, a Fighter's History arcade cabinet appears along with several other arcade cabinets.[11]","title":"","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/7e/Fighter%27s_History_game_flyer.png","developer":"","genre":""},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_IV","description":"Final Fantasy IV (ファイナルファンタジーIV, Fainaru Fantajī Fō?) is a role-playing video game developed and published by Square (now Square Enix) in 1991 as a part of the Final Fantasy series. The game was originally released for the Super Famicom in Japan and has since been rereleased for many other platforms with varying modifications. The game was re-titled Final Fantasy II during its initial release outside of Japan as the original Final Fantasy II and Final Fantasy III had not been released outside of Japan at the time. However, later localizations used the original title.The game's story follows Cecil, a dark knight, as he tries to prevent the sorcerer Golbez from seizing powerful crystals and destroying the world. He is joined on this quest by a frequently changing group of allies. Final Fantasy IV introduced innovations that became staples of the Final Fantasy series and role-playing games in general. Its \"Active Time Battle\" system was used in five subsequent Final Fantasy games, and unlike prior games in the series, IV gave each character their own unchangeable character class.With its character-driven plot, use of new technologies and critically acclaimed score by Nobuo Uematsu, Final Fantasy IV is regarded as a landmark of the series and the role-playing genre. The various incarnations of the game have sold more than four million copies worldwide. An enhanced remake, also called Final Fantasy IV, with 3D graphics was released for the Nintendo DS in 2007 and 2008. A sequel, Final Fantasy IV: The After Years, was released for Japanese mobile phones in 2008, and worldwide via the Wii Shop Channel on June 1, 2009. In 2011, both Final Fantasy IV and The After Years were released for the PlayStation Portable as part of the compilation Final Fantasy IV: The Complete Collection, which also included a new game, set between the two; Final Fantasy IV: Interlude. Ports of the Nintendo DS remake were released for iOS in 2012, for Android in 2013 and for Windows in 2014.In Final Fantasy IV, the player controls a large cast of characters and completes quests to advance the story. Characters move and interact with people and enemies on a field map, which may represent a variety of settings, such as towers, caves, and forests. Travel between areas occurs on a world map. The player can use towns to replenish strength, buy equipment, and discover clues about their next destination.[2] Conversely, the player fights monsters at random intervals on the world map and in dungeons. In battle, the player has the option to fight, use magic or an item, retreat, change character positions, parry, or pause. Certain characters have special abilities.[2] The game was the first in the series to allow the player to control up to five characters in their party; previous games had limited the party to four.[3]Final Fantasy IV introduced Square's Active Time Battle (ATB) system, which differed from the turn-based designs of previous RPGs. The ATB system centers on the player inputting orders for the characters in real time during battles.[5] The system was used in many subsequent Square games.[3]Each character has certain strengths and weaknesses; for instance, a strong magic user may have low defense, while a physical fighter may have low agility. Like other Final Fantasy games, characters gain new, more powerful abilities with battle experience. Magic is classified as either \"White\" for healing and support; \"Black\" for offense; or \"Summon\" (or \"call\") for summoning monsters to attack or carry out specialized tasks.[2] A fourth type, \"Ninjutsu,\" consists of support and offensive magic and is available to only one character. Magic users, who account for eight of the twelve playable characters, gain magic spells at preprogrammed experience levels or fixed story events. The game includes balanced point gains, items, and rewards to eliminate long sessions of grinding.[6] Due to the Super Nintendo's greater processing power, Final Fantasy IV contains improved graphics when compared to previous Final Fantasy titles, all of which were released on the NES. The game employs the Super Nintendo's Mode 7 technology to give enhanced magic spell visuals and to make airship travel more dramatic by scaling and tilting the ground for a bird's eye view.[7]Most of Final Fantasy IV takes place on Earth, also known as the Blue Planet,[8] which consists of a surface world (or Overworld), inhabited by humans, and an underground world (or Underworld), inhabited by the Dwarves. An artificial moon orbits the planet, upon which the Lunarians live. The Lunarians are a race of beings originally from a world which was destroyed, becoming the asteroid belt surrounding the Blue Planet, and are identified by a moon-shape crest on their foreheads. They created the artificial moon, resting until a time when they believe their kind can co-exist with humans.[3] A second, natural moon orbits the Blue Planet as well, although it is never visited in the game.Final Fantasy IV offers twelve playable characters, each with a unique, unchangeable character class. During the game, the player can have a total of five, or fewer, characters in the party at any given time. The main character, Cecil Harvey, is a dark knight and the captain of the Red Wings, an elite air force unit of the kingdom of Baron. He serves the king alongside his childhood friend Kain Highwind, the commander of the Dragoons. Rosa Farrell is a white mage and archer, as well as Cecil's love interest. The Red Wings' airships were constructed by Cecil's friend, the engineer Cid Pollendina.[3]Final Fantasy IV begins as the Red Wings are attacking the city of Mysidia to steal their Water Crystal. When Cecil, Captain of the Red Wings, afterwards questions the king's motives, he is stripped of his rank and sent with Kain to deliver a package to the Village of Mist.[9] There, Kain and Cecil watch in horror as monsters from inside the package destroy the village. A young girl, Rydia, is the only survivor and summons an earthquake in anger, separating Cecil and Kain.[10] Cecil awakens afterward and takes the wounded Rydia to a nearby inn. Baron soldiers come for Rydia but Cecil defends her,[11] and she joins him on his journey.After completing Final Fantasy III in 1990, Square planned to develop two Final Fantasy games—one for the Nintendo Entertainment System and the other for the forthcoming Super Nintendo Entertainment System, to be known as Final Fantasy IV and Final Fantasy V respectively.[30] Due to financial and scheduling constraints, Square dropped plans for the NES game and continued development of the SNES version, retitled Final Fantasy IV. A mock-up screenshot of the cancelled title was produced for a Japanese magazine, but little other information exists about it.[30] Final Fantasy IV director Hironobu Sakaguchi has stated that the NES version was approximately 80% complete and certain ideas were reused for the SNES version.[31]Final Fantasy IV was lead designer Takashi Tokita's first project at Square as a full-time employee. Before this, Tokita wanted a career as a theater actor, but working on the game made him decide to become a \"great creator\" of video games.[32] Initially Hiromichi Tanaka, the main designer of Final Fantasy III, was also involved in the development of the game. However, Tanaka wanted to create a seamless battle system that had no separate battle screen and was not menu-driven, and since Final Fantasy IV was not going in that direction, he changed development teams to work on the action RPG Secret of Mana instead.[33] The development team of Final Fantasy IV contained 14 people in total, and the game was completed in roughly one year.[34]Initial ideas were contributed by the game's director, Hironobu Sakaguchi, including the entire story and the name of Baron's royal air force, the \"Red Wings\".[1][35] The Active Time Battle (ATB) system was conceived and designed by Hiroyuki Ito when he was inspired while watching a Formula One race and seeing racers pass each other at different speeds. This gave him the idea of different speed values for the individual characters.[36][37] The system was developed by Kazuhiko Aoki, Ito and Akihiko Matsui.[38] As the game's lead designer, Tokita wrote the scenario and contributed pixel art.[39] He stated that there was a lot of pressure and that the project would not have been completed if he did not work diligently on it. According to Tokita, Final Fantasy IV was designed with the best parts of the previous three installments in mind: the job system of Final Fantasy III, the focus on story of Final Fantasy II, and the four elemental bosses acting as \"symbols for the game\" as in the first installment.[34] Other influences include Dragon Quest II.[40] The themes of Final Fantasy IV were to go \"from darkness to light\" with Cecil, a focus on family and friendship among the large and diverse cast, and the idea that \"brute strength alone isn't power.\"[35] Tokita feels that Final Fantasy IV is the first game in the series to really pick up on drama,[34] and the first Japanese RPG to feature \"such deep characters and plot.\"[41]The score of Final Fantasy IV was written by longtime series composer Nobuo Uematsu. Uematsu has noted that the process of composing was excruciating, involving trial and error and requiring the sound staff to spend several nights in sleeping bags at Square's headquarters. His liner notes were humorously signed as being written at 1:30 AM \"in the office, naturally.\"[43] The score was well received; reviewers have praised the quality of the composition despite the limited medium.[4][44] The track \"Theme of Love\" has even been taught to Japanese school children as part of the music curriculum.[45] Uematsu continues to perform certain pieces in his Final Fantasy concert series.[46]Three albums of music from Final Fantasy IV have been released in Japan. The first album, Final Fantasy IV: Original Sound Version, was released on June 14, 1991 and contains 44 tracks from the game. The second album, Final Fantasy IV: Celtic Moon, was released on October 24, 1991, and contains a selection of tracks from the game, arranged and performed by Celtic musician Máire Breatnach. Lastly, Final Fantasy IV Piano Collections, an arrangement of tracks for solo piano performed by Toshiyuki Mori, was released on April 21, 1992 and began the Piano Collections trend for each successive Final Fantasy game. Several tracks have appeared on Final Fantasy compilation albums produced by Square, including The Black Mages and Final Fantasy: Pray. Independent but officially licensed releases of Final Fantasy IV music have been orchestrated by such groups as Project Majestic Mix, which focuses on arranging video game music.[47] Selections also appear on Japanese remix albums, called dōjin music, and on English remixing websites such as OverClocked ReMix.[48]Because the previous two installments of the Final Fantasy series had not been localized and released in North America at the time, Final Fantasy IV was distributed as Final Fantasy II to maintain naming continuity.[49] This remained the norm until the release of Final Fantasy VII in North America (after the release of Final Fantasy VI under the title of Final Fantasy III) and subsequent releases of the original Final Fantasy II and III on various platforms. Final Fantasy II has since gone under the title Final Fantasy IV.The English localization of Final Fantasy IV retains the storyline, graphics, and sound of the original, but the developers significantly reduced the difficulty for beginning gamers.[50] Square were worried that western fans would find it difficult to adjust to the game's complexity due to not having played the previous two entries, so decreased the overall depth considerably.[51] Other changes include the removal of overt Judeo-Christian religious references and certain potentially objectionable graphics. For example, the magic spell \"Holy\" was renamed \"White\", and all references to prayer were eliminated; the Tower of Prayers in Mysidia was renamed the Tower of Wishes. Direct references to death were also omitted, although several characters clearly die during the course of the game.[52] The translation was changed in accordance with Nintendo of America's censorship policies (at a time before the formation of the ESRB and its rating system).[53]In addition to its original release, Final Fantasy IV has been remade into many different versions. The first of these was Final Fantasy IV Easytype, a modified version of the game which was released for the Super Famicom in Japan. The Easytype was designed to be even easier than its North American counterpart. In this version, the attack powers of weapons have been enhanced, while the protective abilities of certain accessories and armor are amplified.[50]Final Fantasy IV was ported again by Tose for the Game Boy Advance and published as Final Fantasy IV Advance (ファイナルファンタジーIVアドバンス, Fainaru Fantajī Fō Adobansu?). It was released in North America by Nintendo of America on December 12, 2005; in Japan by Square Enix on December 15, 2005; in Australia on February 23, 2006; and in Europe on June 2, 2006. In Japan, a special version was available which included a limited edition Game Boy Micro with a themed face plate featuring artwork of Cecil and Kain.[60] The enhanced graphics from the WonderSwan Color port were further improved, and minor changes were made to the music. The localization team revised the English translation, improving the flow of the story, and restoring plot details absent from the original.[50] The abilities that were removed from the original North American release were re-added, while spells were renamed to follow the naming conventions of the Japanese version, changing \"Bolt2\" to \"Thundara\" for example.[52] A new cave at Mt. Ordeals was added featuring powerful armor and stronger weapons for five additional characters, as was the Lunar Ruins, a dungeon accessible only at the end of the game.[50]The game was remade with 3D graphics for the Nintendo DS as part of the Final Fantasy series' 20th anniversary, and was released as Final Fantasy IV in Japan on December 20, 2007, in North America on July 22, 2008, and in Europe on September 5, 2008.[61] The remake adds a number of features not present in the original, such as voice acting, minigames, and some changes to the basic gameplay. The game was developed by Matrix Software, the same team responsible for the Final Fantasy III DS remake, and was supervised by members of the original development team: Takashi Tokita served as executive producer and director, Tomoya Asano as producer and Hiroyuki Ito as battle designer. Animator Yoshinori Kanada storyboarded the new cutscenes.Along with Final Fantasy IV: The After Years, the game was released for the PlayStation Portable as part of the compilation Final Fantasy IV: The Complete Collection. This version used updated 2D graphics, as opposed to the 3D graphics seen in the DS remake. The collection also includes a new episode called Final Fantasy IV: Interlude, which takes place between the original game and The After Years. Masashi Hamauzu arranged the main theme for the game.[64] It was released in Japan on March 24, 2011, in North America on April 19, 2011, in Europe on April 21, 2011, and in Australia on April 28, 2011.[65] On December 18, 2012 the PlayStation port was re-released as part of the Final Fantasy 25th Anniversary Ultimate Box Japanese package.[66]In December 2012, the Nintendo DS version of Final Fantasy IV was released for the iOS and Android(June 2013) mobile platforms, introducing an optional easier difficulty level.[67] On September 17, 2014, with no prior advertisement, Final Fantasy IV was also released for Microsoft Windows.[68]Major reviewers have called Final Fantasy IV one of the greatest video games of all time, noting that it pioneered many now common console role-playing game features, including \"the whole concept of dramatic storytelling in an RPG.\"[81][82] Reviewers have praised the game for its graphics, gameplay and score,[50][81] and have noted that Final Fantasy IV was one of the first role-playing games to feature a complex, involving plot.[6][44] Upon release in 1991, Nintendo Power proclaimed it set a \"new standard of excellence\" for role-playing games.[83] In addition, GamePro rated it a perfect 5 out of 5 score in its March 1992 issue.[69] Dragon reviewer Sandy Petersen gave it an \"Excellent\" rating, praising the music, difficulty, and story, noting that, in a departure from most RPGs where the party always \"sticks together through thick and thin,\" the characters in this game instead have their own motives and often separate from the group, with one that \"even betrays\" them. He noted that it is like \"following the storyline of a fantasy novel,\" comparing it to The Lord of the Rings as well as Man in the Iron Mask, and that because \"the characters often spoke up for themselves,\" he \"got much more attached\" to the party \"than in any other computer game.\"[73]Final Fantasy Collection sold over 400,000 copies in 1999, making it the 31st best selling release of that year in Japan.[89] Weekly Famitsu gave it a 54 out of 60 points, scored by a panel of six reviewers.[56] The Game Boy Advance version, Final Fantasy IV Advance, was met with praise from reviewers,[70] although a few noted the game's graphics do not hold up well to current games, especially when compared to Final Fantasy VI.[50][90] Reviewers noted that some fans may still nitpick certain errors in the new translation.[81] The Nintendo DS version of the game was praised for its visuals, gameplay changes and new cutscenes.[91][92][93] It was a nominee for Best RPG on the Nintendo DS in IGN's 2008 video game awards.[94]In Japan, 1.44 million copies of Final Fantasy IV '​s Super Famicom version were sold.[95] By March 31, 2003, the game, including the PlayStation and WonderSwan Color remakes, had shipped 2.16 million copies worldwide, with 1.82 million of those copies being shipped in Japan and 340,000 abroad.[96] As of 2007 just before the release of the Nintendo DS version, nearly 3 million copies of the game had been sold around the world.[3] By May 2009, the DS version of the game had sold 1.1 million copies worldwide.[97]Final Fantasy IV: The After Years, the sequel to Final Fantasy IV, is set seventeen years after the events of the original. The first two chapters of the game were released in Japan in February 2008 for NTT DoCoMo FOMA 903i series phones, with a release for au WIN BREW series phones slated for Spring 2008. The game revolves around Ceodore, the son of Cecil and Rosa, with most of the original cast members returning, some of whom are featured in more prominent roles than before, among other new characters.[98][99] After the mobile release, it was hinted that The After Years would be released outside of Japan.[100] On March 25, 2009, an announcement was made by Satoru Iwata during Nintendo's GDC 2009 Keynote speech that the U.S. would see The After Years released later that year on the Wii's WiiWare service.[101] The first two chapters were released on June 1, 2009 in North America and June 5, 2009 in PAL territories, with the additional chapters being released in the following months.[102][103]A two-volume novelization of Final Fantasy IV was released in Japan on December 25, 2008.[104][105]","title":"Final Fantasy IV","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/90/Final_Fantasy_IV.jpg/220px-Final_Fantasy_IV.jpg","developer":"Square","genre":"Role-playing"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_VI","description":"Final Fantasy VI (ファイナルファンタジーVI, Fainaru Fantajī Shikkusu?, also known as Final Fantasy III for the SNES version) is a role-playing video game developed and published by Square (now Square Enix) for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) platform. Released in 1994, it is the sixth title in the mainline Final Fantasy series. Set in a fantasy world with a technology level equivalent to that of the Second Industrial Revolution, the game's story focuses on a group of rebels as they seek to overthrow an imperial dictatorship. The game features fourteen permanent playable characters, the most of any game in the main series.It was ported by Tose with minor differences to Sony's PlayStation in 1999 and Nintendo's Game Boy Advance in 2006, and it was released for the Wii's Virtual Console in Japan in March 15, 2011, followed by the PAL region on March 18, 2011 and North America on June 30, 2011. The game was known as Final Fantasy III when it was first released in North America, as the original Final Fantasy III had not been released outside of Japan at the time. However, most later localizations used the original title. Final Fantasy VI was the first game in the series to be directed by someone other than producer and series creator Hironobu Sakaguchi; the role was filled instead by Yoshinori Kitase and Hiroyuki Ito. Yoshitaka Amano, a long-time contributor to the Final Fantasy series, returned as the image and character designer, while regular composer Nobuo Uematsu wrote the game's score, which has been released on several soundtrack albums.Final Fantasy VI was released to critical acclaim and is seen as a landmark title for the role-playing genre; for instance, it was ranked as the number one RPG of all time by IGN.[7] Its Super Nintendo and PlayStation versions have sold over 3.48 million copies worldwide to date as a stand-alone game, as well as over 750,000 copies as part of the Japanese Final Fantasy Collection and the North American Final Fantasy Anthology. Final Fantasy VI has won numerous awards since its release.Like previous Final Fantasy installments, Final Fantasy VI consists of four basic modes of gameplay: an overworld map, town and dungeon field maps, a battle screen, and a menu screen. The overworld map is a scaled-down version of the game's fictional world, which the player uses to direct characters to various locations. As with most games in the series, the three primary means of travel across the overworld are by foot, chocobo, and airship. With a few plot-driven exceptions, enemies are randomly encountered on field maps and on the overworld when traveling by foot. The menu screen is where the player makes such decisions as which characters will be in the traveling party, which equipment they wield, the magic they learn, and the configuration of the gameplay. It is also used to track experience points and levels.[8]Combat in Final Fantasy VI is menu-based, in which the player selects an action from a list of such options as Fight, Magic, and Item. A maximum of four characters may be used in battles, which are based on the series' traditional Active Time Battle (ATB) system first featured in Final Fantasy IV. Under this system, each character has an action bar that replenishes itself at a rate dependent on their speed statistic. When a character's action bar is filled, the player may assign an action. In addition to standard battle techniques, each character possesses a unique special ability. For example, Locke possesses the ability to steal items from enemies, while Celes' Runic ability allows her to absorb most magical attacks cast until her next turn.[9]Characters in Final Fantasy VI can be equipped with a wide variety of weapons, armor and accessories (known as \"Relics\") to increase their statistics and obtain special abilities. Most of this equipment can be used by several different characters, and each character may equip up to two Relics. Relics have a variety of uses and effects, some of which alter basic battle commands, allow characters to use multiple weapons, provide permanent status changes during battle or use protective magical spells in response to being near death.[11]Although only two characters start the game with the ability to use magic, almost every character can learn to do so. Characters may equip magicite, which enables the summoning of espers, this game's incarnation of summoned monsters (including several recurring summons such as Ifrit, Shiva, Bahamut and Odin, along with many new summons exclusive to Final Fantasy VI), as well as that of specific magic spells. If a character has a piece of magicite equipped, he or she will gain \"Magic Acquisition Points\" after most battles. As a character gains magic AP, he or she gradually learns spells from the magicite equipped and will gain additional statistic bonuses when leveling up, depending on the magicite.[12]Final Fantasy VI takes place on a large, unnamed world. During the course of the game, its geography and landscape change due to various developments in the game's plot. During the first half of the game, the world is divided into three major continents and referred to as the World of Balance. The northern continent is punctuated by a series of mountain ranges and contains many of the locations accessible to the player. Most of the southern continent has been taken over by the Empire, while the eastern continent is home to a large patch of land called the Veldt where monsters from all over the world can be found. Halfway through the game, the world's geographical layout is altered, resulting in its three large continents splitting into several islands of various size situated around a larger continent at their center. This altered layout of the game's locations is referred to as the World of Ruin.In contrast to the medieval settings featured in previous Final Fantasy titles, Final Fantasy VI is set in a steampunk environment. The structure of society parallels that of the latter half of the 19th century, with opera and the fine arts serving as recurring motifs throughout the game,[13] and a level of technology comparable to that of the Second Industrial Revolution. Railroads and steamships are in use, and a coal mining operation is run in the northern town of Narshe.[14] Additionally, several examples of modern engineering and weaponry (such as a chainsaw, drill and automatic crossbow) have been developed in the Kingdom of Figaro. However, communication systems have not reached significant levels of development, with letters sent by way of carrier pigeon serving as the most common means of long-distance communication.Final Fantasy VI features fourteen permanent playable characters, the most of any game in the main series, as well as several secondary characters who are only briefly controlled by the player. The starting character, Terra Branford, is a reserved half-human, half-esper girl who spent most of her life as a slave to the Empire, thanks to a mind-controlling device, and is unfamiliar with love.[18] Other primary characters include Locke Cole, a treasure hunter and rebel sympathizer with a powerful impulse to protect women; Celes Chere, a former general of the Empire, who joined the Returners after being jailed for questioning imperial practices; Edgar Figaro, a consummate womanizer and the king of Figaro, who claims allegiance to the Empire while secretly supplying aid to the Returners;[19] Sabin Rene Figaro, Edgar's brother, who fled the royal court in order to pursue his own path and hone his martial arts skills; Cyan Garamonde, a loyal knight to the kingdom of Doma who lost his family and friends as a result of Kefka poisoning the kingdom's water supply; Setzer Gabbiani, a habitual gambler and thrill seeker and owner of the world's only airship; Shadow, a ninja mercenary, who offers his services to both the Empire and the Returners at various stages throughout the game; Relm Arrowny, a young but tough artistic girl with magical powers; Strago Magus, Relm's elderly grandfather and a Blue Mage; Gau, a feral child surviving since infancy in the harsh wilderness known as the Veldt; Mog, a Moogle from the mines of Narshe; Umaro, a savage but loyal sasquatch also from Narshe, talked into joining the Returners through Mog's persuasion; and Gogo, a mysterious, fully shrouded master of the art of mimicry.Most of the main characters in the game hold a significant grudge against the Empire and, in particular, Kefka, who serves as one of the game's main antagonists along with Emperor Gestahl. The supporting character Ultros serves as a recurring villain and comic relief throughout the game. A handful of Final Fantasy VI characters have reappeared in later games, such as Secret of Evermore. Additionally, Final Fantasy SGI, a short tech demo produced for the Silicon Graphics Onyx workstation, featured polygon-based 3D renderings of Locke, Terra, and Shadow.[20]Final Fantasy VI begins with Terra Branford participating in an Imperial raid on Narshe in search of a recently unearthed frozen esper (later identified as Tritoch; Valigarmanda in the GBA retranslation) found in the city's mines. The esper kills her controllers and the Imperial control over her is broken, but she is unable to remember anything about her past.[21] Locke Cole, a treasure hunter, promises to protect her until she can regain her memories and helps her escape to the hideout of the Returners, a group of militants opposing the Empire. Along the way, they pass through the Kingdom of Figaro and meet Edgar Roni Figaro, the king, and his estranged brother, Sabin Rene Figaro, who join them. Banon, the leader of the Returners, asks for Terra's help in their struggle against the Empire, and she agrees.[22] Just as the resistance is preparing to return to Narshe to investigate the frozen esper, the Empire attacks South Figaro. Locke heads to the besieged town to slow the Empire's advance, while the rest of the group makes their way via rafting down the nearby Lethe River. However, Sabin is separated from the group after a battle with Ultros, self-proclaimed \"octopus royalty\" and a recurring antagonist, forcing the various members of the Returners to find their own ways to Narshe in three different scenarios controlled by the player. In Locke's scenario, he must escape the imperial occupied town of South Figaro without detection. Sabin has been swept to a distant continent and must find a way back while Terra, Edgar, and Banon will continue to float down the Lethe River back to Narshe.Final Fantasy VI entered development after the release of its predecessor Final Fantasy V in December 1992.[1] The development of the game took just one year to be completed.[35] Series creator and director Hironobu Sakaguchi could not be as intimately involved as in previous installments due to his other projects and his promotion to Executive Vice President of the company in 1991.[1][36][37] For that reason, he became the producer and split director responsibilities for Final Fantasy VI up between Yoshinori Kitase and Hiroyuki Ito: Kitase was in charge of event production and the scenario, while Ito handled all battle aspects.[1][38] Sakaguchi supervised Kitase's cutscene direction and ensured that the project would coalesce as a whole. The idea behind the story of Final Fantasy VI was that every character is the protagonist. All members of the development team contributed ideas for characters and their \"episodes\" for the overall plot in what Kitase described as a \"hybrid process\".[1] Consequently, Terra and Locke were conceived by Sakaguchi; Celes and Gau by Kitase; Shadow and Setzer by graphic director Tetsuya Nomura; and Edgar and Sabin by field graphic designer Kaori Tanaka.[1][38] Then it was Kitase's task to unite the story premise provided by Sakaguchi with all the individual ideas for character episodes to create a cohesive narrative.[1][39] The scenario of Final Fantasy VI was written by a group of four or five people, among them Kitase who provided key elements of the story, such as the opera scene and Celes' suicide attempt, as well as all of Kefka's appearances.[36][40][41]Yoshitaka Amano, a long-time contributor to the Final Fantasy series, returned as the image and character designer. His concept art became the basis for the models in the full motion videos produced for the game's PlayStation re-release.[42] Tetsuya Takahashi, one of the graphic directors, drew the imperial Magitek Armors seen in the opening scene. By doing so, he disregarded Sakaguchi's intention to reuse the regular designs from elsewhere in the game.[38][43] The sprite art for the characters' in-game appearance was drawn by Kazuko Shibuya.[44] While in the earlier installments, the sprites were less detailed on the map than in battle, Final Fantasy VI's had an equally high resolution regardless of the screen. This enabled the use of animations depicting a variety of movements and facial expressions.[45] Though it was not the first game to utilize the Super Nintendo's Mode 7 graphics, Final Fantasy VI made more extensive use of them than its predecessors. For instance, unlike both Final Fantasy IV and Final Fantasy V, the world map is rendered in Mode 7, which lends a somewhat three-dimensional perspective to an otherwise two-dimensional game.[46]The original North American localization and release of Final Fantasy VI by Square for the Super Nintendo featured several changes from the original Japanese version. The most obvious of these is the change of the game's title from Final Fantasy VI to Final Fantasy III; because only two games of the series had been localized in North America at the time, Final Fantasy VI was distributed as Final Fantasy III to maintain naming continuity. Unlike Final Fantasy IV (which was first released in North America as Final Fantasy II), there are no major changes to gameplay, though several changes of contents and editorial adjustments exist in the English script. In a January 1995 interview with Super Play magazine, translator Ted Woolsey explained that \"there's a certain level of playfulness and ... sexuality in Japanese games that just doesn't exist here [in the USA], basically because of Nintendo of America's rules and guidelines\".[47] Consequently, objectionable graphics (e.g. nudity) were censored and building signs in towns were changed (such as Bar being changed to Café), as well as religious allusions (e.g. the spell Holy was renamed Pearl).[48]The PlayStation re-release featured only minor changes to the English localization. The title of the game was reverted to Final Fantasy VI from Final Fantasy III, to unify the numbering scheme of the series in North America and Japan with the earlier release of Final Fantasy VII. A few item and character names were adjusted, as in the expansion of \"Fenix Down\" to \"Phoenix Down\". Unlike the PlayStation re-release of Final Fantasy IV included in the later Final Fantasy Chronicles compilation, the script was left essentially unchanged.[42] The Game Boy Advance re-release featured a new translation by a different translator, Tom Slattery.[49] This translation preserved most of the character names, location names, and terminology from the Woolsey translation, but changed item and spell names to match the conventions used in more recent titles in the series.[50] The revised script preserved certain quirky lines from the original while changing or editing others, and it cleared up certain points of confusion in the original translation.[51] The Wii Virtual Console release used the Final Fantasy III name of the SNES game.The soundtrack for Final Fantasy VI was composed by long-time series contributor Nobuo Uematsu. The score consists of themes for each major character and location, as well as music for standard battles, fights with boss enemies and for special cutscenes. The extensive use of leitmotif is one of the defining points of the audio tracks. The \"Aria di Mezzo Carattere\" is one of the latter tracks, played during a cutscene involving an opera performance. This track features an unintelligible synthesized \"voice\" that harmonizes with the melody, as technical limitations for the SPC700 sound format chip prevented the use of an actual vocal track (although some developers eventually figured out how to overcome the limitation a few years later). The orchestral album Final Fantasy VI Grand Finale features an arranged version of the aria, using Italian lyrics performed by Svetla Krasteva with an orchestral accompaniment. This version is also found in the ending full motion video of the game's Sony PlayStation re-release, with the same lyrics but a different musical arrangement. In addition, the album Orchestral Game Concert 4 includes an extended version of the opera arranged and conducted by Kōsuke Onozaki and performed by the Tokyo Symphony Orchestra, featuring Wakako Aokimi, Tetsuya Ōno, and Hiroshi Kuroda on vocals.[52] It was also performed at the \"More Friends\" concert[53] at the Gibson Amphitheatre in 2005 using a new English translation of the lyrics, an album of which is now available.[54] \"Dancing Mad\", accompanying the game's final battle with Kefka, is 17 minutes long and contains an organ cadenza, with variations on Kefka's theme. The \"Ending Theme\" combines every playable character theme into one composition lasting over 21 minutes.[55]The original score was released on three Compact Discs in Japan as Final Fantasy VI: Original Sound Version.[55] A version of this album was later released in North America as Final Fantasy III: Kefka's Domain, this version of the album is the same as its Japanese counterpart, except for different packaging and small differences in the translation of some track names between the album and newer releases.[56] Additionally, Final Fantasy VI: Grand Finale features eleven tracks from the game, arranged by Shirō Sagisu and Tsuneyoshi Saito and performed by the Ensemble Archi Della Scala and Orchestra Sinfonica di Milano (Milan Symphony Orchestra).[57] Piano Collections: Final Fantasy VI, a second arranged album, features thirteen tracks from the game, performed for piano by Reiko Nomura.[58] More recently, \"Dancing Mad\", the final boss theme from Final Fantasy VI, has been performed at Play! A Video Game Symphony in Stockholm, Sweden on June 2, 2007, by the group Machinae Supremacy.[59]Final Fantasy VI was ported to the Sony PlayStation by Tose and re-released by Square in Japan and North America in 1999. In Japan, it was available both by itself and as part of Final Fantasy Collection, while in North America it was available only as part of Final Fantasy Anthology. In Europe it was sold by itself. Fifty thousand limited-edition copies of the Japanese version were also released in Japan and included a Final Fantasy-themed alarm clock.[61]Final Fantasy VI '​s PlayStation re-release is very similar to the original Japanese release as seen on the Super Famicom. With the exception of the addition of two full motion video opening and ending sequences and new effects used for the start and end of battles, the graphics, music and sound are left unchanged from the original version. The only notable changes to gameplay (in addition to loading times not present in the cartridge versions) involve the correction of a few software bugs from the original and the addition of a new \"memo save\" feature, allowing players to quickly save their progress to the PlayStation's RAM.[62] The re-release included other special features, such as a bestiary and an artwork gallery.[63] On December 18, 2012 the port was re-released as part of the Final Fantasy 25th Anniversary Ultimate Box Japanese package.[64]Final Fantasy VI was ported a second time by Tose and re-released as Final Fantasy VI Advance by Square Enix in Japan on November 30, 2006, by Nintendo in North America on February 5, 2007, and in Europe on July 6, 2007,[65] for the Game Boy Advance. This was the last Game Boy Advance game released in Asia. It includes additional gameplay features, slightly better visuals, and a new translation that follows Japanese naming conventions for the spells and monsters. It does not, however, have the full-motion videos from the PlayStation version of the game. Four new espers are in this re-release: Leviathan, Gilgamesh, Cactuar, and Diabolos. Two new areas include the Dragons' Den dungeon, which includes the Kaiser Dragon, a monster coded but not included in the original, and a \"Soul Shrine\", a place where the player can fight monsters continuously. Three new spells also appear, and several bugs from the original are fixed. In addition, similarly to the other handheld Final Fantasy re-releases, a bestiary and a music player are included. Interestingly, even in the Japanese version, the music player is in English and uses the American names, e.g. Strago over Stragus.[66] The package features new artwork by series veteran and original character and image designer Yoshitaka Amano.[67]Final Fantasy VI was released as a PSone Classic in Japan on April 20, 2011, and in PAL territories on June 2, 2011.[71] It was released in North America on December 6, 2011.[4]Takashi Tokita, a director and producer at Square Enix, announced on October 10, 2013 that the company will be releasing a mobile-optimized version of Final Fantasy VI for iOS and Android operating systems in the winter of 2013.[72][73] The versions include remade graphics.[74] The game was released on Android on January 15, 2014,[75] while the iOS version was released on February 6, 2014.[6]Final Fantasy VI received critical acclaim and was commercially successful upon release—it is now considered to be one of the greatest video games of all time, and on many major gaming sites such as IGN, the best in the Final Fantasy series. As of March 31, 2003, the game had shipped 3.48 million copies worldwide, with 2.62 million of those copies being shipped in Japan and 860,000 abroad.[92] Final Fantasy Collection sold over 400,000 copies in 1999, making it the 31st-best-selling release of that year in Japan.[93] It received 54 out of 60 points from Weekly Famitsu, scored by a panel of six reviewers.[61] Final Fantasy Anthology has sold approximately 364,000 copies in North America.[94]The game garnered rave reviews upon its original release. GamePro rated it as 5 out of 5, stating that \"characters, plotlines, and multiple-choice scenarios all combine to form one fantastic game!\"[89] Electronic Gaming Monthly granted a 9 out of 10 and named it game of the month, commenting that \"RPGs with this much depth and realism come once in a blue moon\".[85] It won several awards from Electronic Gaming Monthly in their 1994 video game awards, including Best Role-Playing Game, Best Japanese Role-Playing Game, and Best Music for a Cartridge-Based Game.[91] Additionally, they later ranked the game ninth in their 1997 list of the 100 greatest console games of all time.[84] For their part, Nintendo Power declared the game \"the RPG hit of the decade\", noting its improved sound and graphics over its predecessors, and the game's broadened thematic scope.[95] Moreover, they suggested that \"with so much story and variation of play ... fans may become lost in the world for months at a time\".[96] In 1997, they ranked it as the eighth greatest Nintendo game, saying it \"had everything you could want—heroes, world-shattering events, magic, mindless evil—plus Interceptor the wonder dog!\"[97] In 2010, Nintendo Power listed the ending to Final Fantasy VI as one of the best finales, citing the great character moments that cement them as some of the most memorable Final Fantasy protagonists ever; they also listed the opera scene as being a demonstration of how touching and emotional role-playing games can be.[98]Final Fantasy VI is often regarded as one of the best titles in the series and one of the best role-playing video games ever created. In 2005, IGN placed Final Fantasy VI 56th on their list of the 100 greatest games, as the second highest ranked Final Fantasy title on the list after Final Fantasy IV.[103] In 2006, Nintendo Power ranked it as the 13th top 200 game on any Nintendo platform, suggesting that it might be the \"best\" Final Fantasy ever.[104] That same year, readers of the Japanese magazine Famitsu voted it as the 25th best game of all time.[105] In 2008, Final Fantasy VI took the #1 spot on G4 TV's \"Top Must Own RPGs\" list.[106] That same year, ScrewAttack named Final Fantasy VI the third best SNES game, beaten only by The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past and Super Metroid.[107] In 2009, Final Fantasy VI was inducted into the IGN Videogame Hall of Fame, becoming the second Final Fantasy game to do so (the only other Final Fantasy to do so was the original Final Fantasy).[108] In 2012, also IGN put Final Fantasy VI as number one on their list of the top role-playing video games, stating: \"There are too many moments in Final Fantasy VI worthy of celebration to name them all. Biggs and Wedge leading Terra through the snow. The poisoning of Doma. Sandy boots. The destruction of the world. A tragic opera. Ultros! We hold these close to our hearts, and that's not even including Espers and the most poignant character themes in the series to date. So cheers, Final Fantasy VI. May your name follow us as we all tumble towards the future of art, entertainment, narrative, and everything that keeps us gaming.\"[7] In an updated version of the \"Top 100\" list in 2007, IGN ranked Final Fantasy VI as the ninth top game of all time, above all other Final Fantasy games in the series. They continued to cite the game's character development, and especially noted Kefka as \"one of the most memorable bad guys in RPG history.\"[109] In 2009, Game Informer put the SNES version of Final Fantasy III eighth on their list of the top games of all time, opining that it \"perfected the 2D role-playing game.\"[110] It fell from its seventh place ranking the staff gave it in 2001.[111] In 2012, the staff of GamesRadar ranked it as the ninth best SNES game, stating that \"for it to remain so effective and so moving for so long after its 1994 release means it is a true work of art, and demands to sit high atop any list, regardless of platform (we did already name it the 14th best game of all time).\"[112]Final Fantasy VI: The Interactive CG Game (also known as the Final Fantasy SGI demo, or Final Fantasy x, not related to the actual 10th game in the Final Fantasy series, Final Fantasy X) was a short game demo produced by Square using characters and settings from Final Fantasy VI. Produced using new Silicon Graphics, Inc. (SGI) Onyx workstations acquired by Square, the demo was Square's first foray into 3D graphics, and many assumed that it was a precursor to a new Final Fantasy title for the Nintendo 64 video game console, which also used SGI hardware.[20] Square, however, had not yet committed to Nintendo's console at the time of the demo's production, and much of the technology demonstrated in the demo was later put to use in the rendering of FMV sequences for Final Fantasy VII and subsequent games for the PlayStation. The demo itself featured Terra Branford, Locke Cole, and Shadow in a series of battles. The game was controlled largely through mouse gestures: for example, moving the cursor in the shape of a star would summon a dragon to attack.[20]On April 27, 2010, Square Enix producer Shinji Hashimoto stated that the development of a remake of Final Fantasy VI for the Nintendo DS was \"undecided\" due to \"technical issues\".[113] Later, however, Square discussed remaking VI as well as V for the Nintendo 3DS.[114]","title":"Final Fantasy VI","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/05/Final_Fantasy_VI.jpg/220px-Final_Fantasy_VI.jpg","developer":"Square","genre":"Role-playing"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_Mystic_Quest","description":"Final Fantasy Mystic Quest, released as Mystic Quest Legend in PAL regions and as Final Fantasy USA: Mystic Quest (ファイナルファンタジーUSA ミスティッククエスト, Fainaru Fantajī Yū Esu Ē Misutikku Kuesuto?) in Japan, is a role-playing video game for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. The game was released as a spin-off to Square's popular Final Fantasy series of video games. Final Fantasy Mystic Quest was first released in North America in 1992 and marketed as a \"simplified role-playing game...designed for the entry-level player\"[1] in an attempt to broaden the genre's appeal.[2] The game's presentation and battle system is broadly similar to that of the main series, but it differed in its inclusion of action-adventure game elements. Along with Final Fantasy Adventure, Final Fantasy Mystic Quest was the first Final Fantasy game to be released in Europe.Like previous games in the series, Final Fantasy Mystic Quest is presented in a top-down perspective (or bird's eye view), with players directly navigating the main character around the world to interact with objects and people. The game features a unique way of traveling the world map. Unlike past Final Fantasy games, players cannot freely roam the world map. Instead, they travel along set paths from one \"icon\" (pictorial image on the world map) to the next. Some routes are blocked off (restriction is indicated by a gray arrow), but become accessible when the player succeeds in a specific task, such as completing a dungeon. Once its path is open, the player can enter an icon; the game's plot and action takes place within these icons, which include towns, dungeons, and battlefields.[3] The game is characterized by featuring action-adventure game elements; besides jumping, players can use weapons outside of battle, which play an active role in exploration. Players can chop down trees with an axe, detonate bombs to open sealed doorways, or use a grappling hook to clear wide gaps.[4] The game also has more puzzles than earlier Final Fantasy games. In the Falls Basin, for example, players must move pillars of ice across the ground level in such a fashion that they can be used as platforms to jump across on the second level. Final Fantasy Mystic Quest also does away with save points; players can save their progress at any time during exploration.[5]Final Fantasy Mystic Quest eliminates the system of random enemy encounters, a trademark of the main series. Instead, battles are represented in dungeons as stationary enemy sprites, and the player is given the option of approaching the enemy and engaging a battle. Once engaged in battle, the player is thrust into the battle screen, which presents a window-based menu with three commands to choose from: battle, run, or control. Running from battle transports the player back to the field screen, while choosing \"control\" toggles between the ally's battle mode, where the player can manually control the main character's ally or opt for a computer-controlled ally. If players choose to battle, they are presented with a submenu of four more options: physically attack the enemy, cast a spell, use a curative item (such as a Cure potion), or defend.[6] The game's battle system relies on conditional turn-based combat, where the characters and enemies cycle through \"rounds\" in battling each other, with the most turns awarded to the fastest character. Character health is represented by an incremental life bar, although the player may choose to have it displayed in numerical fractions as in most role-playing games. If all character life bars reach zero, the game is over, but the player is given the option of continuing and restarting the battle. If the player chooses this option, however, the main character's attack power may suffer temporarily as a penalty. A character's performance in battle is determined by numerical figures (called statistics) for vitality, attacking power, defensive capabilities, speed, magical prowess, accuracy, and evasion. Character statistics are driven by experience points (EXP) gained from winning battles, which accumulate until players achieve milestones known as \"experience levels.\" Besides awarding experience points, battling enemies also earns the player Gold Pieces (GP), which can be used to buy weapons, armor, and curative items. In the absence of random enemy encounters, battlefields are scattered across the world map. Players are immediately thrust into a battle when entering a battlefield, and must win ten enemy battles to \"clean out\" the battlefield. Once a battlefield is cleaned out, players are awarded either a large amount of experience, a large amount of GP, a piece of armor, or a magic spell.[6]Unlike all other Final Fantasy games, players cannot manually equip characters with armor. Instead, newly acquired armor replaces the main character's current equipment, or upgrades a current version of a weapon, e.g. obtaining the knight sword will replace the steel sword. Using the L and R buttons allow the user to cycle through the weapons that have been collected so far. Benjamin uses four types of weapons: swords, axes, bombs, and claws. Although the weapons share a similar function in battle, all have different purposes when exploring the field map. The Dragon Claw, for example, doubles as a grappling hook. The weapon arsenal in Final Fantasy Mystic Quest is considerably smaller than most role-playing games.[7]Magic in Final Fantasy Mystic Quest is not learned by designated spellcasters through experience. Instead, the main character acquires magic spells through treasure chests or as a reward for clearing out battlefields. The system of spellcasting is similar to that of the original Final Fantasy; rather than using magic points to draw upon for supplying magic, spells are used according to a set number for their type, i.e., white magic, black magic, or wizard magic. The allotted number for each type increases as a character levels up. A spell's effectiveness is also proportional to a character's experience level. The higher the character's level, the more powerful the Cure spell, for example. The spell catalog in Final Fantasy Mystic Quest is limited compared to most other Final Fantasy games.[7] Items in the game are analogous to the spells: their potency increases as the character levels up. The Heal potion acts as a cure-all for status ailment, eliminating the need for status recovery items.[7]The fictional events of Final Fantasy Mystic Quest take place on a single continent of an unnamed world, which is divided into four distinct regions: Foresta, Aquaria, Fireburg, and Windia. The welfare of each region is determined by the state of one of four shining crystals: earth, water, fire, and wind, respectively. For centuries the Focus Tower had stood at the heart of the world. It had been a center for trade and knowledge, and the world's people met there to peacefully settle their differences. But on one warm summer day, powerful monsters stormed the Tower, stole the four crystals, and then took off with the magical coins that kept the Tower's doors unlocked. The monsters began consuming the power of the crystals; they grew in strength while the world began to decay. An old prophecy tells that at the time the \"vile four\" steal the power and divide the world behind four doors, a knight will appear to vanquish the darkness.[8]Although designed by one of Square's development teams in Japan, Final Fantasy Mystic Quest was specifically geared for the U.S. market. At the time, console role-playing games were not a major genre in North America; Square thus attempted to broaden the genre's appeal through Final Fantasy Mystic Quest.[2] Square had already released several Final Fantasy spinoffs in North America, including the first three titles in the SaGa (series) as \"Final Fantasy Legend\", and the first Mana (series) game as \"Final Fantasy Adventure\", and wished to further break into the popular American consciousness.[9] Square's executives cited the alleged difficulty of RPGs as the reason Americans shied away from them, and eased the difficulty level by tweaking various aspects of the main series' gameplay.[2] The American release of Final Fantasy IV had been made much easier, for example, and Mystic Quest was made easier still, even having the Japanese developers work with the American offices to make sure the game was playable for children.[9]After its U.S. debut, Final Fantasy Mystic Quest was released in Japan under the title Final Fantasy USA: Mystic Quest.[9] The European release of the game was released in English, German and French, and had the title changed to Mystic Quest Legend to avoid confusion with Final Fantasy Adventure, which had been released in Europe as Mystic Quest.[15] Final Fantasy Mystic Quest was first unveiled in June at the 1992 Summer Consumer Electronics Show in Chicago, where it was a popular venue,[2] and the game was later presented in more detail in the Fall 1992 issue of the Ogopogo Examiner.Final Fantasy Mystic Quest's soundtrack was composed by Ryuji Sasai and Yasuhiro Kawakami.[16] It was the first game in the Final Fantasy series not to be composed by regular series composer Uematsu.[17] The album was first released on one Compact Disc by NTT Publishing on September 10, 1993.[16] ROM capacity limits and hardware limitations made the composition process difficult.[18] After the game was completed, Sasai recorded two remixes on his days off for the game's album, and personally played the guitar parts.[18] “Mountain Range of Whirlwinds” was built off of Sasai's liking of the sound of the french horn, and its ability to go the length of the song and convey a sense of mountains.[18] The track \"Last Castle\" was written in a short time, and was used to create imagery of a field, but its length left very little space for the \"Battle 3\" song.[18]'","title":"Final Fantasy Mystic Quest","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f6/Final_Fantasy_Mystic_US_boxart.jpg/256px-Final_Fantasy_Mystic_US_boxart.jpg","developer":"Square","genre":"Role-playing game"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fight","description":"Final Fight (Japanese: ファイナルファイト?) is a side-scrolling beat-'em-up produced by Capcom. Originally released as an arcade game in 1989, it was the seventh title released for the CP System hardware. Set in the fictional Metro City, the player controls one of three characters—former pro wrestler and newly elected mayor Mike Haggar, his daughter's boyfriend Cody, and Cody's best friend Guy—as they set out to defeat the Mad Gear gang and rescue Haggar's young daughter Jessica.The game began development as a sequel to the original Street Fighter released in 1987, but the genre was switched from a fighting game to a beat 'em up and the title was changed following the success of Double Dragon. The Final Fight development team later worked on the original Street Fighter II and some of the characters from Final Fight later appeared as playable fighters in other entries of the franchise such as the Street Fighter Alpha sub-series.Final Fight was ported to various home consoles such as the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and was followed by a few sequels. The total sales of the Final Fight series have totaled 3.4 million units.[1]Final Fight can be played by up to two players simultaneously. Before the game begins, the player chooses between the three main characters: Haggar, Cody, and Guy. Each has his own fighting style and attributes. Health gauges are displayed for both player and enemy characters.The controls for Final Fight consist of an eight-way joystick and two buttons for attacking and jumping respectively. Pressing the attack button repeatedly when attacking an enemy or multiple enemies will cause the player character to perform a combo. The final blow of the combo can be changed to a throw if the player moves the joystick in the opposite direction just before landing it. The player can also perform a jump attack. Pressing the attack and jump buttons simultaneously allows the player to perform a special attack that strikes all surrounding enemies, but will drain a small portion of the player's health.Final Fight consists of six stages or \"rounds\", as well as two bonus rounds. Each round takes place in a different section of Metro City such as the Slums and the Subway, with most rounds featuring more than one level. At the end of each round the player will face a boss character unique to that round.Yoshiki Okamoto cites the arcade version of Double Dragon II: The Revenge as his basis for Final Fight.[2] Final Fight was originally shown at trade shows under the title of Street Fighter '89.[3] According to Okamoto, the sales division of Capcom originally requested a Street Fighter sequel, so his team decided to promote Final Fight as a Street Fighter sequel at trade shows (going as far to refer to one of the main characters as a \"former Street Fighter\"). The title was changed to Final Fight before its official release after feedback from operators stating that the game was nothing like Street Fighter.[2]A port of Final Fight for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System was released as a launch title for the platform in Japan in 1990 and later in North America in 1991 and then in the PAL region in 1992. It was released for the Wii '​s Virtual Console service in 2007 and the Wii U's Virtual Console in 2013. The SNES port removed the two-player co-op option, the Industrial Area level, and playable character Guy. Most of the scene transitions were also edited out. In the arcade version, the player characters would be seen exiting the levels and breaking through doors unlike the SNES version. Due to hardware limitations the SNES version could only display two or three enemies on-screen, in contrast to the CPS arcade version, which could display up to nine or ten enemies on-screen; to make up for this difference, the SNES version features more stopping points than the arcade version and the enemy placement is vastly different.[citation needed]A revised edition of the SNES port, titled Final Fight Guy, was released in Japan in 1992. This version replaced Cody with Guy as a selectable character (with a new opening and ending sequence explaining Cody's absence), included four difficulty settings, and added other new features such as two new power-ups, although the Industrial Area stage and the Two-Player mode were still omitted. An American version of the game (featuring the same changes in the localization as in the first game) was released in June 1994 as a rental-only game that was initially available at Blockbuster stores, although it was later given a limited release.[10] Kajino's music port was retained for that version.U.S. Gold released ports of Final Fight for the Amiga, Atari ST, Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum and Amstrad CPC for the European market in 1991. These ports were developed by Creative Materials. In February 1993, the ZX Spectrum version was released as part of the Super Fighter compilation with Pit Fighter and WWF WrestleMania.[11]The Mega-CD/Sega CD version, titled Final Fight CD, was ported and published by Sega under license from Capcom in 1993. This version retains nearly all the features of the arcade game that were removed in the two SNES ports (namely the two-player mode, the Industrial Area stage, and the ability to play as any of the three main characters) and adds voice acting to the game's opening and ending sequences, an arranged version of the original soundtrack, and an exclusive time attack mode. However the maximum number of on-screen enemies were still lower than the arcade version and the combo attacks of Cody and Guy are much slower. Like the SNES version, the Mega-CD version was censored for the English localization with many of the same changes. Poison and Roxy were kept, but were redrawn with less revealing clothing.[12]The Game Boy Advance version, titled Final Fight One, was released in 2001. Final Fight One features all three characters and the Industrial Area stage that was missing from the SNES version. The 2-player cooperative mode is also featured via link cable. Dialogue scenes prior to each boss battle have been added and the Street Fighter Alpha 3 renditions of Cody and Guy are featured as hidden playable characters. Other unlockable features include alternate palettes for each player character and the ability for two players to use the same character. The character and background designs are lifted from the SNES versions rather than the original arcade version, with the enemy placement being similar to Final Fight Guy, although the maximum number of on-screen enemies was increased and all the transition sequences were restored. The same new power-up items introduced in Final Fight Guy are also present in this version, along with a new Cody doll item. The English localization of the game featured the same changes as the two SNES versions. Poison and Roxy were replaced by Billy and Sid again, though Damnd and Sodom kept their original names.[13]On September 15, 2011 Final Fight was released into Apple's iTunes Store. This version includes all three characters from the Arcade version, a multiplayer feature that can only be used with Wi-Fi and a special items where you can turn on Extra Lives, Super Special, and Meat Explosion.[14]Final Fight is included in the 2005 compilation Capcom Classics Collection Volume 1 for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox, and in the 2006 portable version Capcom Classics Collection Remixed for the PlayStation Portable. The game is emulated from the original CP System arcade version and features very little differences from the arcade game. The compilation includes tips, character profiles, an art gallery and a sound test as bonus features.[4]The arcade version is also included as a hidden bonus game in the 2006 game Final Fight: Streetwise for the PS2 and Xbox. However, the emulation in this version was programmed by Ultracade, rather than Digital Eclipse (the developers of Capcom Classics Collection series). The controls cannot be adjusted and the quality is lower than other emulated versions.The arcade version of Final Fight was released in a two-in-one bundle titled Final Fight: Double Impact, alongside the arcade game Magic Sword, for Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network. Added features include various graphic filters, including an arcade cabinet view, online drop-in multiplayer, an arranged soundtrack composed by Simon Viklund (who worked on Bionic Commando Rearmed), and extra content such as concept art and comic pages which are unlocked by completing certain in-game challenges. The game was ported and developed by Proper Games and released for Xbox Live Arcade for 800 Microsoft points and April 15, 2010 for PlayStation Network for $9.99.[15] The PS3 version features a very restrictive DRM protection which circumvents the ability other PSN games have to be shared among several PSN accounts. The DRM protection was met with a negative response as it had not been disclosed previous to the game's release.[16] On March 27, 2012, Double Impact was released as part of the Capcom Digital Collection for the Xbox 360.[17]In the February 1991 issue of the Japanese coin-operated video game magazine Gamest, Final Fight took No. 1 spot as Best Game of 1990 in the 4th Annual Grand Prize. Final Fight also won the category of Best Action Game, placed No. 4 in Best Video Game Music, No. 9 in Best Graphics, No. 2 in Best Direction, and No. 5 in Best Album. The character Mike Haggar was displayed on the cover of this issue, who took the No. 1 spot in the Top 50 Characters of the year, with Guy in second place, Cody at No. 7, Poison at No. 26, Sodom at No. 33, and Jessica at No. 40.[24]","title":"Final Fight","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/35/Final_Fight_%28flyer%29.jpg/254px-Final_Fight_%28flyer%29.jpg","developer":"Capcom","genre":""},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fight_2","description":"Final Fight 2 is a side-scrolling beat 'em up video game released by Capcom for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) in 1993.

Final Fight 2 was developed by Capcom '​s consumer division with no preceding coin-op version. The game was re-released onto Wii's Virtual Console service in 2009 for the North American and European regions.Unlike the SNES version of the first game, Final Fight 2 supports two-player simultaneous play and has a total of three playable characters. The only playable character from the first game to return is Mike Haggar. Two new player characters were introduced: Carlos and Maki Genryusai. In the game's plot, the three battle the resurgent Mad Gear gang at various locations around the world to rescue Maki's sister and father, who are also the fiancée and teacher respectively of Guy from the first Final Fight.Capcom followed up the game with another SNES-exclusive sequel, Final Fight 3, which saw the return of Guy to the series. None of the new characters from Final Fight 2 returned, although Maki made appearances in various Capcom fighting games years later.Final Fight 2 does not deviate much from the original Final Fight in terms of gameplay, although unlike the SNES version of the first game (and the alternate version Final Fight Guy), Final Fight 2 features a two-player cooperative mode in addition to the single-player mode. The player has a choice between three characters: Haggar, who uses professional wrestling techniques; Maki, a female master of the fictional ninjutsu school of Bushin-ryū Ninpō, similar to Guy from the first game; and Carlos, a South American martial artist of Japanese descent who uses a sword for his Special Move. Through use of a code, two players can select the same character. Like in the original game, each character has their own set of fighting techniques and abilities unique to each character.The Japanese version of Final Fight 2 features two enemy characters named Mary and Eliza, who are knife-wielding female enemies with acrobatic techniques. Mary and Eliza were replaced by two substitute characters named Leon and Robert in the international versions of the game. Additionally, the first stage boss Won Won, wields a meat cleaver in the Japanese version, which was also removed in the overseas versions.Lucas M. Thomas of IGN, in the review of the 2009 Virtual Console release, called it \"decent brawler experience\" even as \"pretty straightforward\" and \"a bit bland\", although wondering why Guy was not included when his fiancée was kidnapped in the story.[1] Nevertheless, the staff of GamesRadar ranked it as the 31st best SNES game: \"We were afraid the sequel might see similar limitations, but this one was built from the ground up for Nintendo’s super console, so everything we’d want from an arcade Final Fight 2 made its way to the cartridge.

Flashback was initially released for the Amiga in 1992, then ported to MS-DOS, Acorn Archimedes, Sega Mega Drive/Genesis and Super Nintendo in 1993. CD-ROM versions of Flashback for the Mega-CD, 3DO, CD-i, MS-DOS, Apple Macintosh and the FM Towns were released during 1994 and 1995, together with a cartridge version for the Atari Jaguar in 1995.Originally advertised as a \"CD-ROM game on a cartridge\", the game features fully hand-drawn backdrops and all animation is rotoscoped, giving movements an unusual fluidity, similar to that of the earlier Prince of Persia. The capture technique of Flashback was invented independently of Prince of Persia, and used a more complicated method of first tracing video images onto transparencies.The game was a commercial and critical success and was listed in the Guinness World Records as the best-selling French game of all time. It was followed by a sequel titled Fade to Black in 1995. In 2013, a Flashback remake by VectorCell was released for the PC and consoles.As a cinematic platformer, Flashback features gameplay similar to that of 1989's Prince of Persia, and Delphine's own Another World released in 1991. Each level spans a large number of non-scrolling screens, nearly all of which feature multiple levels of altitude — requiring the player character Conrad to jump, grab onto ledges, climb, use elevators, and drop onto lower levels. Conrad exhibits realistic human running speed and jumping ability, as well as realistic weakness — he will die if he falls from too great a height.Electronic Gaming Monthly praised the SNES version for having improved graphics and music over the Genesis version. They remarked that Flashback is slow-paced at times, but retains the player's interest through its compelling plot and involving puzzles.[8] MegaTech magazine conceded that although there were \"five big levels\", finishing the game did not take very long.In 1994, Mega placed the game at number eight in their list of top Mega Drive games of all time.[11] In February 2011, Wirtualna Polska ranked it as the 17th best Amiga game[12] and the Polish edition of CHIP ranked it as the tenth best Amiga game.[13] In 2004, readers of Retro Gamer voted Flashback as the 65th top retro game.[14]A sequel titled Fade to Black was produced by Delphine Software International in 1995 for the PC and PlayStation as a 3D game. A third game in the series, Flashback Legends, was in development by both Delphine Software International and Adeline Software International for a planned released in 2003, but was cancelled when the company went bankrupt and ceased operations at the end of 2002.In early 2013, a game titled Flashback Origins was rumoured to be in development, with the French website Gameblog stating that €300,000 of government funding had been granted to Cuisset's VectorCell in 2011.[15][16] On April 11, 2013, a remake of Flashback was announced with a reveal trailer.[15]OnEscapee was originally developed as an Amiga CD title, and has since been released as PC freeware. The game contains many similarities to both the Flashback style of gameplay and concept.","title":"Flashback","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8d/Flashback_cover.png/256px-Flashback_cover.png","developer":"Delphine Software International","genre":"Cinematic platformer"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Flintstones_(film)#Marketing","description":"The Flintstones is a 1994 American comedy film directed by Brian Levant and written by Tom S. Parker, Jim Jennewein and Steven E. de Souza. A live-action adaptation of the 1960-66 animated television series The Flintstones, the film stars John Goodman as Fred Flintstone, Rick Moranis as Barney Rubble, Elizabeth Perkins as Wilma Flintstone, and Rosie O'Donnell as Betty Rubble, along with Kyle MacLachlan as an executive-vice president of Fred's company, Halle Berry as his seductive secretary and Elizabeth Taylor, in her final theatrical film, as Wilma's mother. The B-52's performed a different version of the theme song. The movie was shot in California at an estimated budget of $46,000,000. The film was released on May 27, 1994 and was a box-office success, though it was panned by critics and received negative reviews by the consensus of film critics. Observers criticized the storyline and tone, which they deemed too \"dumbed down\" for family audiences, but praised its visual effects, costume design, art direction and John Goodman's performance as Fred Flintstone.Slate and Co. Senior Executive Cliff Vandercave (Kyle MacLachlan) and secretary Miss Sharon Stone (Halle Berry) look at the company workers in the gravel pits while discussing their plan to swindle the company of its vast fortune and flee, but agree that they need a stooge to take the fall for it.Fred Flintstone (John Goodman) loans his best friend and neighbor Barney Rubble (Rick Moranis) money so that he and his wife Betty (Rosie O'Donnell) can adopt a child named Bamm-Bamm, who can only pronounce his own name. Although the child was initially difficult to control due to being raised by Mastadons, as well as being superstrong, he eventually warms up to his new family. Barney vows to repay his friend, but Fred receives an unwelcome visit from his mother-in-law, Pearl Slaghoople (Elizabeth Taylor), who dislikes Fred and berates him for \"robbing the nest egg\". Fred's wife, Wilma (Elizabeth Perkins), remains supportive of Fred's decision, however.Cliff holds an aptitude test, where the worker with the highest mark will become the new Vice President of the company. Barney gets the highest score, but remembers his promise and switches his paper with Fred, whom he knows will fail miserably. Fred receives the promotion, but his first order is to fire Barney, since Barney now effectively has the lowest score. Fred reluctantly complies, but does his best to help Barney support his family, even inviting the Rubbles to live with them so that they can rent out their home. However, the perks of Fred's new job put a strain on his friendships, as Wilma catches him in a flirtatious moment with Miss Stone, and the Rubbles are put off by Fred and Wilma's increasingly snobbish behaviour. Cliff eventually tricks Fred into firing all the workers, despite advice from his office dictabird (Harvey Korman). Things come to a head at a restaurant where Barney, working as a waiter, sees the workers rioting on the news, and confronts Fred. In the ensuing argument, Barney finally admits that he switched tests with Fred, and the Rubbles move out, despite having nowhere to live. Disgusted with Fred's behaviour, Wilma leaves Fred for her mother's house, taking their daughter Pebbles with her.Fred goes to the quarry and discovers his mistake and Cliff's plot, but also learns that Cliff has engineered the scheme to make it look as if Fred embezzled the money, and calls the police. A manhunt for Fred ensues, by the police and the angry workers. Wilma and Betty see this on the news, and break into Slate and Co. to get the dictabird, the only witness who can clear Fred, unaware that Cliff saw them from his office window. Fred tries to infiltrate a cave where the workers are seeking refuge, but they see through his disguise and try to lynch him. Barney shows up, now working as a snow cone vendor, and is almost hanged as well after he admits his part. Fred and Barney make up, but before they can be hanged, Wilma and Betty turn up with the dictabird, who tells the workers that Cliff was the one who fired them and convinces them to let Fred and Barney go.However, Cliff breaks into Fred's house, vandalize it, kidnaps Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm, ties up Pearl and Dino, and writes them a note saying \"if YOU want to see YOUr kIds AGain, Bring the Dictabird to ThE QuaRRy at dawn. NO PoLICE\", demanding the Dictabird in exchange for their safe return. Fred and Barney confront Cliff at the quarry, where Cliff has tied Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm to a huge machine. Though they hand him the Dictabird, Cliff sets the machine off to stall them. Barney rescues the children while Fred destroys the machine. The dictabird escapes from Cliff and lures him back to the quarry, where Miss Stone knocks him out, having had a change of heart after learning that Cliff planned to betray her. The police arrive with Wilma and Betty and Cliff attempts to flee, but is stopped by a falling substance which engulfs and traps him after turning solid.With the dictabird's help, Fred is cleared of all charges, while Miss Stone is arrested as Cliff's accomplice, though Fred is confident she will be set free for helping them stop Cliff. Mr. Slate (Dann Florek), impressed with the substance that Fred inadvertently created by destroying the machine, dubs the substance \"concrete\" and makes plans to produce it with Fred as President of its division, thus ending the Stone Age, but Fred, having experienced wealth, declines, instead requesting his old job back, which Mr. Slate respectfully accepts. As the Flintstones and Rubbles have finally made up, Fred and Barney get into another quarrel when Fred once again asks Barney for a bit of money for breakfast.According to pre-release publicity for The Flintstones, Sharon Stone was to play Miss Sharon Stone, but turned it down as she was already working on The Specialist. Nicole Kidman was the second choice for the role, but Halle Berry won the part after a screen test. Steven Spielberg said Danny DeVito was the original first choice for Barney. DeVito eventually turned down the role as he felt he was too gruff to do the character properly and reportedly suggested Rick Moranis for the role. Premiere magazine showed Elizabeth Montgomery as being considered for the role of Pearl Slaghoople. Rosie O'Donnell claims she won the role of Betty Rubble with her impersonation of the cartoon character's signature giggle.In 1985, producers Keith Barish and Joel Silver bought the rights for a live-action feature film version of The Flintstones and commissioned Steven E. de Souza to write a script with Richard Donner hired to direct. Silver was said to be interested in casting James Belushi in the role of Fred. De Souza's script was eventually rejected and Mitch Markowitz was hired to write a script. Said to be a cross of \"The Grapes of Wrath\", Markowitz commented that \"I don't even remember it that well, but Fred and Barney leave their town during a terrible depression and go across the country, or whatever that damn prehistoric thing is, looking for jobs. They wind up in trailer parks trying to keep their families together. They exhibit moments of heroism and poignancy.\" Markowitz's version was apparently too sentimental for director Donner, who disliked it.[3]Eventually, the rights were bought by Amblin Entertainment and Steven Spielberg who, after working with John Goodman on Always, was determined to cast him in the lead as Fred. Brian Levant was hired as director, knowing he was the right person because of his love for the original series. They knew he was an avid fan of the series because of his Flintstones items collection and the knowledge he had from the series. When Levant was hired, all previous scripts for the film were thrown out. Levant then recruited what he called an \"all-star writing team\" which consisted of his writer friends from television shows such as Family Ties, Night Court and Happy Days. \"This is a sitcom on steroids,\" said Levant. \"We were just trying to improve it.\" Dubbed the Flintstone Eight, the group wrote a new draft but four more round table sessions ensued, each of which was attended by new talent. Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel took home a reported $100,000 for just two days work.[4] Rick Moranis was also present at Levant's roundtables, and later described the film as \"one of those scripts that had about 18 writers.\" [5]The effects for Dino, Dictabird, and the other prehistoric creatures were provided by Jim Henson's Creature Shop.The film received generally negative reviews by film critics. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gave the film a 22% \"Rotten\" rating based on 41 reviews with an average rating of 3.8/10. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film has received an average score of 38 out of 100, which indicates \"generally unfavorable reviews\", based on 38 reviews.On the TV series Siskel and Ebert, Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune and Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film two thumbs down. They both mentioned that its main story lines (embezzlement, mother-in-law problems, office politics and extra-marital affairs) were storylines for adult films, and ones that children wouldn't be able to understand. However, many critics praised the film's look and costume design, which was made by Rosanna Norton and John Goodman's performance.[6][7][8][9]Rosie O'Donnell won the Razzie Award for Worst Supporting Actress for her performance in this film. The film also won Worst Screenplay and was nominated for two others: Elizabeth Taylor as Razzie Award for Worst Supporting Actress (the second performance in the film nominated for this award) and for the film as Worst Remake or Sequel. However, the film also received four Saturn Award nominations, including Best Fantasy Film, Best Costume Design and Best Supporting Actress for Rosie O'Donnell's and Halle Berry's performances.In 1997 interview, Flintstones co-creator and Hanna-Barbera co-founder/co-chairman Joseph Barbera stated that, although he was impressed by the film's visuals, he felt the story \"wasn't as good as I could have made it.\"[10]Despite the negative reviews, The Flintstones was a box office success, grossing $130,531,208 domestically, including the $37,182,745 it made during its 4-day Memorial Day opening weekend in 1994. It fared even better overseas, making another $211,100,000, for a total of $341,631,208 worldwide, against a $46 million budget.[11][12]The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas was released in 2000 (six years after the first film). The original cast did not reprise their roles as the main characters, though Rosie O'Donnell provided the voice of an octopus who gave massages to the younger versions of Betty & Wilma. And Irwin Keyes returned as Joe Rockhead, the only cast member to reprise his original role from the first film. Unlike its predecessor, it failed at the box office.McDonald's marketed a number of Flintstones promotions for the movie, including the return of the McRib sandwich and the \"Grand Poobah Meal\" combo with it, a line of premium glass mugs, and toys based on characters & locations from the movie. In the commercials and released items for the Flintstones promotion, McDonald's was renamed \"RocDonald's\" with stone age imagery, similarly to other businesses and proper names in the Flintstones franchise.A video game based on the film was developed by Ocean software and released for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, Game Boy and Mega Drive/Genesis (Sega Channel exclusive) in 1995.The film was released on VHS and Laserdisc on November 8, 1994 by MCA Universal Home Video, then made its DVD debut on September 24, 2002. Universal Studios Home Entertainment released the movie on Blu-ray on August 19, 2014.","title":"","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/dc/Flintstones_ver2.jpg/220px-Flintstones_ver2.jpg","developer":"","genre":""},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Flintstones:_The_Treasure_of_Sierra_Madrock","description":"The Flintstones: The Treasure of Sierra Madrock is a side scrolling action video game by Taito for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System.

It was developed by SCE Cambridge Studio and published by Hasbro Interactive in November 1997. The game is an expansion of the original arcade game, sporting levels with large maps, an updated set of graphics rendered in 3D, and additional gameplay moves. Critical reaction was mixed, with frequent criticism towards the gameplay, controls, and difficulty; while the graphics were received positively. Despite the mixed reception from critics, it was a commercial success, with the PlayStation version going on to become one of the best-selling titles for the console.Frogger was followed by Frogger 2: Swampy's Revenge, which builds on the gameplay elements found in this game. This was the last game to have the K-A rating.The player begins with five lives (three on the PlayStation version). If a player dies, they return to the starting point of the level. Frogger's new abilities include being able to eat flies of various types, croak, and jump upwards onto ledges to take advantage of the 3D perspective. Flies and croaking tend to add to the player's score, though select insects allow Frogger to speed up, become invincible for a short period, or earn an extra life.Frogger has 38 total levels, with 33 of those being single-player levels. The rest are multiplayer levels, shown in bold text. Despite Frogger having 33 levels, there are only 23 unique layouts. This is due to some levels being recycled. When maps are recycled, the second appearance on this list is in italics. Recycled levels usually have similar names for both their appearances. (NOTE: No zone names are displayed in-game and are thus conjectural. Descriptions of the zone icons are in parentheses next to the zone names.)Frogger: He's Back! received mixed reactions from critics, with a GameRankings score of 60.38% for the PC version and a 49.82% for the PlayStation version.Criticism of the game was primarily targeted towards the game's design, which reviewers felt followed too closely to the original arcade game. Stephen Poole of GameSpot argued that Hasbro \"[leaving] some of the old video game conventions unchanged\" was \"where Frogger disappoints\" in his review of the PC version.[4] The game's tendency to bring the player back to the starting point of the level once a frog was collected (as in the original) Poole complained \"turned challenges into frustrations\" because \"you wind up covering the same ground over and over again\", and ultimately concluded that \"the 'new and improved' Frogger probably won't convert anyone who didn't care for the old one.\" A reviewer for Game Revolution agreed, arguing \"the nature of the game with its time limits\" makes it \"impossible\" to play a level for a lengthy amount of time before dying. The reviewer likewise assumed that Frogger \"really doesn't have anything that would capture [new players'] fancy\", though said the game \"should sell very well to the numerous fans of the old coin-op.\"[5] Adam Douglas of IGN blasted the game's camera, \"terribly poor\" controls, and \"impossibly high level of difficulty\", claiming they result in \"an unplayable game\" and summarized the game's faults as \"[conspiring] to make Frogger one of the worst PlayStation games yet seen.\"[6] Conversely, fellow GameSpot reviewer Joe Fielder called Frogger \"an enjoyable title\" in his review of the PlayStation version, saying the gameplay \"contained hours of super fun\" and spoke highly of the Retro Stages, claiming they were \"almost worth the price of the game.\"[3] Fielder however did make note the game's mixed reception among reviewers, saying the difficulty in the later stages and multiplayer levels would alienate players.The graphics and soundtrack received positive remarks. Fielder commented on the game's soundtrack as \"extremely catchy\", and described the 3D graphics as \"polygonal origami.\"[3] GameRevolution spoke favorably about the graphics, claiming \"the designers definitely deserve kodus for their work...the frogs look like frogs, alligators like alligators, and big rigs like big rigs. Frogger is truly the king of amphibian simulations\".[5] Douglas agreed, saying Frogger's \"flat-shaded polygons give the game a pleasant cartoonish look.\"[6] Poole however argued that \"compared with what you'll find in other current releases [the graphics] are not what you'd call inspiring,\" despite being an improvement over the original game, and stated that they \"often they don't convey a true sense of three-dimensionality: Yes, you move downward through the limbs of a tree, but it doesn't really feel like you're moving down.\"[4]","title":"Frogger","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/16/Froggercover.png/256px-Froggercover.png","developer":"SCE Studio Cambridge","genre":"Arcade"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_Throttle:_All-American_Racing","description":"Full Throttle: All-American Racing, known in Japan as Full Power (フル・パワー?),[5] is a racing video game released for the SNES.","title":"Full Throttle: All-American Racing","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/5b/Full_Throttle_All-America_Racing_Coverart.png/220px-Full_Throttle_All-America_Racing_Coverart.png","developer":"Gremlin Interactive","genre":"Racing"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fun_%27n_Games","description":"","title":"Fun 'n Games","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e3/North_American_Genesis_Fun_%27n_Games_front_cover.jpeg","developer":"Leland Interactive Media","genre":"Edutainment"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemfire","description":"Gemfire (released in Japan as Royal Blood or ロイヤルブラッド Roiyaru Buraddo, Super Royal Blood or スーパーロイヤルブラッド Sūpā Roiyaru Buraddo in its Super Famicom version) is a medieval war game for the MSX, Nintendo Entertainment System, Super NES, FM Towns, Mega Drive/Genesis, MS-DOS, and later Windows, developed by Koei. The object in the game is to unify a fictional island by force. Players use soldiers and knights, as well as fantasy units such as magicians, dragons or gargoyles in order to capture the castle needed to control that particular territory.The sea-dwelling dragon of peace known as the Pastha charged the six wizards with the task of fighting back. They succeeded, sealing the Fire Dragon away into a ruby at the top of a crown, and themselves became the six jewels around the crown's base. The crown, called Gemfire, was a symbol of utmost power and authority.When Gemfire fell into the hands of the now current King of Ishmeria, Eselred, he sought to abuse the object's power, using it to embark on a tyrannical reign, instilling fear within his oppressed subjects. Ishmeria fell into despair as his power flourished. Finally, his young daughter, Princess Robyn, could bear to watch her father's grievous misdeeds no longer—she seized Gemfire and pried the six wizard gems loose, causing them to shoot upward into the sky and circle briefly overhead before scattering themselves to different parts of Ishmeria. When a furious Eselred learned of Robyn's actions, he had her locked her away in a tower; but it was futile as the deed had already been done, and Robyn had taken the crucial first step toward freeing her people.Meanwhile, the six wizards each take up residence with a prominent family of Ishmeria. The two most powerful of these clans are the Blanches, led by Prince Erin and supported by Zendor, Emerald Wizard and Wielder of Lightning; and the Lyles, led by Prince Ander and backed by Pluvius, Sapphire Wizard and Caster of Meteors. Four other clans (Flax, Coryll, Chrysalis and Molbrew) also have wizards (Scylla, Empyron, Chylla and Skulryk respectively) of Gemfire at their disposal in the beginning. With the breaking of the spell on Gemfire, each of these clans sets out to unseat Eselred, claim the throne as their own and restore order and peace to Ishmeria.","title":"Gemfire","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/0f/GemfireSNES_boxart.jpg/220px-GemfireSNES_boxart.jpg","developer":"Koei","genre":"Turn-based strategy"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genghis_Khan_II:_Clan_of_the_Gray_Wolf","description":"Genghis Khan II: Clan of the Gray Wolf, originally released as Aoki Ōkami to Shiroki Mejika: Genchou Hishi (蒼き狼と白き牝鹿・元朝秘史?), is a 1992 video game developed by Koei.

The game was first made for Amiga and Atari ST computers and then ported for various other platforms. Like other Bitmap Brothers' games, Gods was highly praised by critics thanks to the quality graphics and music.Although Gods might seem a \"jump and run\" platformer, in this game while precise and timed jumping are required to progress, planning each move carefully yields better results health-wise than attempting to speedrun a level, and there are some puzzles (often involving levers and objects) which require the player to go back and forth in the level, since there's only a four space inventory where objects required to get bonuses (such as keys) or to complete a level can be carried. The console versions (especially the Mega Drive/Genesis port) run at a considerably higher speed, which increases the difficulty level. A Game Boy Advance ROM was also released but is no longer commercially available.[2] The console versions do not share the same opening theme music as the PC versions of the game. They do, however, have background music throughout the game, which is notably missing in the PC versions (The PC version only has background music throughout the game with a Roland LAPC-I).","title":"Gods","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a1/Gods_MD_cover.jpg/240px-Gods_MD_cover.jpg","developer":"Bitmap Brothers","genre":"Platformer"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goof_Troop_(video_game)","description":"Goof Troop (グーフィーとマックス - 海賊島の大冒険 Gūfii to Makkusu - Kaizoku Shima no Daibouken, lit. \"Goofy and Max: The Adventures of Pirate Island\") is an action-adventure video game, developed and released by Capcom in 1993 for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System/Super Famicom and based on the television series of the same name.

Especially the bosses and backgrounds were noted for their graphical appearance. The outfit system was also well received and many critics thought it added depth to the gameplay. Sound and music received mixed to positive ratings, as some thought the music loops were too short and that the sound wasn't up to par with the rest of the game, while some found the music and sound effects very suitable to a Disney cartoon game. A great deal of the criticism was geared towards the difficulty of the game. Many reviewers believed that the game was too easy and/or short, mainly due to the game's unlimited continue system that allowed the player to replay a game level until finished, leading to them recommending the game only for younger children.

This is the first game in the long-running series of the same name. A PAL version was released by Nintendo in early 1998 for Western Europe and Oceania, with language localizations for Germany and France.Each year has four thirty-day seasons, and each day lasts from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m, when it becomes dark and the clock stops. Unlike in later Harvest Moon games, the player can effectively stay outside as long as he wants without any penalty to stamina.

No further setting of traps is possible after this period. Each trap can only be triggered once and they all inflict the same amount of damage.In the Home Alone title for the NES, the player must avoid being caught by the Wet Bandits for 20 minutes. During this time, he can set various traps using items around the house, each with a different corresponding strength and allowing the Bandit tripping them to be knocked unconscious longer. Kevin can also hide behind certain parts of the house, but only for two consecutive turns; any other concurrent passings will result in a game over. Some official copies of the NES version have two different \"game over\" screens; one having Kevin McCallister performing his trademark screaming face with a speech balloon on his left side that reads \"Oh no!\", the other one only having a large cloud with \"Oh no!\" in the middle of it.The Home Alone Genesis and Game Gear titles feature a slightly different plot. While the games still revolve around Kevin’s battle with the Wet Bandits, he instead must protect several houses in his neighborhood while waiting 20 minutes for the police to arrive (40 on higher difficulties). During the game, the Wet Bandits drive around the neighborhood in their nondescript van until they decide to enter one of the houses. Kevin can travel by sled (in top-down view) to the various houses and do battle with the Bandits as they proceed to rob whatever house they are in (in a 2D platformer/side-scroller format). When this happens, Kevin must fight them off with different weapons and guns in order to fill up an empty Pain Meter; when he does so, he will have saved that particular house and cause the Bandits to retreat. During this time, however, another meter will be filled as the Bandits proceed to rob the house, and if Kevin is unsuccessful in stopping them (thereby allowing meter to be filled), the house will become “flooded” (Marv leaves the water in robbed houses running as a calling card) and he will be unable to reenter the house again.

Hart and Malia Scotch Marmo. It stars Robin Williams as Peter Pan/Peter Banning, Dustin Hoffman as the character of Captain Hook, Julia Roberts as Tinker Bell, Bob Hoskins as Smee, Maggie Smith as Granny Wendy, Caroline Goodall as Moira Banning, and Charlie Korsmo as Jack Banning. The film acts as a sequel to J. M. Barrie's 1911 novel Peter and Wendy, focusing on a grown-up Peter Pan who has forgotten his childhood. Now known as Peter Banning, he is a successful corporate lawyer with a wife and two children. Hook kidnaps his children, and Peter must return to Neverland and reclaim his youthful spirit in order to challenge his old enemy.Spielberg began developing the film in the early 1980s with Walt Disney Productions and Paramount Pictures, which would have followed the storyline seen in the 1924 silent film and 1953 animated film. Peter Pan entered pre-production in 1985, but Spielberg abandoned the project. James V. Hart developed the script with director Nick Castle and TriStar Pictures before Spielberg decided to direct in 1989. Hook was shot almost entirely on sound stages at Sony Pictures Studios in Culver City, California. The film received mostly negative reviews by critics, and while it was a commercial success, its box office intake was lower than expected. However, it was nominated in five categories at the 64th Academy Awards.Peter Banning (Williams) is a successful corporate lawyer whose career constantly conflicts with his family life, his son Jack feeling particularly neglected when he attends a play starring his daughter Maggie but shows up too late for Jack's baseball game causes a strain in their relationship. They travel to London for a banquet honoring his wife Moira's grandmother Wendy for her charity work regarding orphans. While the adults are out, a mysterious force comes and kidnaps the children, upon their return Toodles, an elderly former ophan living in Wendy's home tells them that Captain Hook has returned and kidnapped Jack and Maggie, and took them to Neverland. Wendy tries to convince Peter that he is in fact Peter Pan and that he must remember who he is to save his children.That night, Tinker Bell confronts a drunken Peter and forcibly takes him to Neverland. She convinces Peter to disguise himself as a pirate, but when he sees Hook with his captive children he reveals himself. Hook, disgusted with Peter's adult self does not believe him to be Pan and wants to kill him and the children, but his henchman Smee deduces that spending so long away from Neverland had wiped all memory of it and who he was. Failing to get his children from fishing net just out of his reach and revealing Peter's fear of heights, Tinker Bell negotiates with Hook that she can get him ready for a fight. Peter is knocked overboard in the agreement of three days training, but he is saved by a school of mermaids and arrives in the Lost Boys' home. Not convinced that the adult is Peter Pan, the boys put him through several humiliating and infuriating trials until he manages to convince them. The current leader of the Lost Boys, Rufio refuses to believe but is forced to go along with it. Meanwhile, Smee convinces Hook to try and turn Jack and Maggie against their father. Maggie refuses to give up, but Jack begins to view Hook as a father figure. When Peter and the boys come to play a prank on Hook as part of his training, Peter sees Jack strike a home run during a pirate baseball game, but becomes upset when Hook calls Jack \"his\" son.Peter returns, determined to learn how to fly and finds the home they'd made for Wendy and her brothers. With Tinker Bell's help, Peter realizes his happy thought was becoming a father for the first time, which was why he returned to Earth and married Moira and first fell in love. Tinker Bell realizes her dream and becomes human-sized for Peter. But he remembers Moira and his family and she bids him to go and save his children. On an assault at the Pirates' base, the Lost Boys and Peter manage to rescue Jack and Maggie, but Hook kills Rufio. Peter fights with Hook, but his children beg him not to kill him. Hook uses this to his advantage and pins Peter down, but with Tinker Bell, the Lost Boys and his children sharing their belief in him he outwits Hook, causing him to awaken the long-dead crocodile that had taken his hand and was turned into a quiet clock. It falls on Hook and devours him. With Neverland free of Hook's tyranny, Peter leaves the largest Lost Boy, Thud-butt in charge and follows his children home.Awakening outside of Wendy's home, Peter bids a fond farewell to Tink and realizes his true priorities are to his family. Locked out of the house, he climbs the drainpipe up to the room where Moira, Wendy and the children are celebrating their return. He comes in, pretending for a moment that he's returned to his former curmudgeonly self before celebrating with them. Toodles, being earlier revealed as a lost boy; having missed the adventure again, is given his lost bag of marbles back, which contains enough fairy dust for him to fly. As he flies around London, Wendy asks if Peter's adventures are over, and Peter says \"No. To live. To live would be an awfully big adventure.\"J. M. Barrie considered writing a story in which Peter Pan grew up; his 1920 notes for the latest stage revival of Peter Pan included possible titles for another play: The Man Who Couldn't Grow Up or The Old Age of Peter Pan.[2] The genesis of Hook started when director Steven Spielberg's mother often read him Peter and Wendy as a bedtime story. Spielberg explained in 1985, \"When I was eleven years old I actually directed the story during a school production. I have always felt like Peter Pan. I still feel like Peter Pan. It has been very hard for me to grow up, I'm a victim of the Peter Pan syndrome.\"[3]In the early 1980s, with Walt Disney Pictures, Spielberg began to develop a film which would have closely followed the storyline of the 1924 silent film and 1953 animated film.[4] He also considered directing Peter Pan as a musical with Michael Jackson in the lead.[5] Jackson expressed interest in the part, but was not interested in Spielberg's vision of an adult Peter Pan who had forgotten about his past.[6] The project was taken to Paramount Pictures, where James V. Hart wrote the first script with Dustin Hoffman already cast as Captain Hook.[5] Peter Pan entered pre-production in 1985 for filming to begin at sound stages in England. Elliot Scott had been hired as production designer.[4] With the birth of his first son, Max, in 1985, Spielberg decided to drop out. \"I decided not to make Peter Pan when I had my first child,\" Spielberg commented. \"I didn't want to go to London and have seven kids on wires in front of blue screens. I wanted to be home as a dad.\"[5] Around this time, Spielberg considered directing Big, which carried similar motifs and themes with Peter Pan.[5] In 1987, Spielberg \"permanently abandoned\" Peter Pan, feeling he expressed his childhood and adult themes in Empire of the Sun.[7]Meanwhile, Paramount and Hart moved forward on production with Nick Castle as director. Hart began to work on a new storyline when his son, Jake, showed his family a drawing. \"We asked Jake what it was and he said it was a crocodile eating Captain Hook, but that the crocodile really didn't eat him, he got away,\" Hart reflected. \"As it happens, I had been trying to crack Peter Pan for years, but I didn't just want to do a remake. So I went, 'Wow. Hook is not dead. The crocodile is. We've all been fooled'. In 1986 our family was having dinner and Jake said, 'Daddy, did Peter Pan ever grow up?' My immediate response was, 'No, of course not'. And Jake said, 'But what if he did?' I realized that Peter did grow up, just like all of us baby boomers who are now in our forties. I patterned him after several of my friends on Wall Street, where the pirates wear three-piece suits and ride in limos.\"[8]By 1989, Ian Rathbone changed the title of Peter Pan to Hook, and took it from Paramount to TriStar Pictures, headed by Mike Medavoy, who was Spielberg's first talent agent. Robin Williams signed on, but Williams and Hoffman had creative differences with Castle. Medavoy saw Hook as a vehicle for Spielberg and Castle was dismissed, but paid a $500,000 settlement.[8] Dodi Fayed, who owned certain rights to make a Peter Pan film, sold his interest to TriStar in exchange for an executive producer credit.[9] Spielberg briefly worked together with Hart to rewrite the script[4] before hiring Malia Scotch Marmo to rewrite Captain Hook's dialog and Carrie Fisher for Tinker Bell's dialog. The Writers Guild of America gave Hart and Marmo screenplay credit, while Hart and Castle were credited with story. Fisher went uncredited. Filming began on February 19, 1991, occupying nine sound stages at Sony Pictures Studios in Culver City, California.[1] Stage 30 housed the Neverland Lost Boys playground, while Stage 10 supplied Captain Hook's ship cabin. Hidden hydraulics were installed to rock the setpiece to simulate a swaying ship, but the filmmakers found the movement distracted the dialogue, so the idea was dropped.[10]Stage 27 housed the full-sized pirate ship Jolly Roger and the surrounding Pirate Wharf.[10] Industrial Light & Magic provided the visual effects sequences, this would also prove the introduction of Tony Swatton's career as he would be asked to make weaponry for the film. Hook was financed by Amblin Entertainment and TriStar Pictures, with TriStar distributing the film. Impressed with his work on Cats, Spielberg brought John Napier as a \"visual consultant\". The original production budget was set at $48 million, but ended up between $60–80 million.[1][11] This was also largely contributed by the shooting schedule, which ran 40 days over its original 76 day schedule. Spielberg explained, \"It was all my fault. I began to work at a slower pace than I usually do.\"[11]Spielberg found close personal connection to the film. The troubled relationship between Peter and his son echoed Spielberg's relationship with his father. Previous films of Spielberg that explored a diminishing father-son relationship included E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. Peter Banning's \"quest for success\" paralleled Spielberg starting out as a film director and transforming into a Hollywood business magnate. This led to Spielberg's divorce from Amy Irving, which possibly reflects Banning's relationship with his family.[12] \"I think a lot of people today are losing their imagination because they are work-driven. They are so self-involved with work and success and arriving at the next plateau that children and family almost become incidental. I have even experienced it myself when I have been on a very tough shoot and I've not seen my kids except on weekends. They ask for my time and I can't give it to them because I'm working.\"[4] Similar to Peter Banning at the beginning of Hook, Spielberg also has a fear of flying. He feels that Peter Pan's \"enduring quality\" in the storyline is simply to fly. \"Anytime anything flies, whether it's Superman, Batman, or E.T., it's got to be a tip of the hat to Peter Pan,\" Spielberg reflected. \"Peter Pan was the first time I saw anybody fly. Before I saw Superman, before I saw Batman, and of course before I saw any superheroes, my first memory of anybody flying is in Peter Pan.\"[4]The film score was composed by John Williams. Williams was brought in at an early stage when Spielberg was considering making the film as a musical. Accordingly, Williams wrote around eight songs for the project at this stage. The idea was later abandoned. Most of Williams's song ideas were incorporated into the instrumental score, though two songs survive as songs in the finished film -- \"We Don't Wanna Grow Up\" and \"When You're Alone\", both with lyrics by Leslie Bricusse.The original 1991 issue was released by Epic Records. In 2012, a limited edition of the soundtrack, called Hook: Expanded Original Motion Picture Soundtrack, was released by La-La Land Records and Sony Music. It contains almost the complete score with alternates and unused material. It also contains liner notes that explain the film's production and score recording.Expanded Original Motion Picture SoundtrackSpielberg, Williams and Hoffman did not take salaries for the film. Their deal called for the trio to split 40% of TriStar Pictures' gross revenues. They were to receive $20 million from the first $50 million in gross theatrical film rentals, with TriStar keeping the next $70 million in rentals before the three resumed receiving their percentage.[1] Hook was released in North America on December 11, 1991, earning $13.52 million in its opening weekend. The film went on to gross $119.65 million in North America and $181.2 million in foreign countries, accumulating a worldwide total of $300.85 million.[15] It is the fifth-highest-grossing \"pirate-themed\" film, behind all four films in the Pirates of the Caribbean film series.[16] In North America totals, Hook was the sixth-highest-grossing film in 1991,[17] and fourth-highest-grossing worldwide.[18] While Hook ended up making a profit of $50 million for the studio, it was still declared a financial disappointment.[19]The film received mixed to negative reviews. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 30% of critics have given the film a positive review, based on 39 reviews, certifying it \"Rotten\", with an average rating of 4.4/10.[20] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote that the \"failure in Hook was its inability to re-imagine the material, to find something new, fresh or urgent to do with the Peter Pan myth. Lacking that, Spielberg should simply have remade the original story, straight, for the '90s generation.\"[21] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone magazine felt Hook would \"only appeal to the baby boomer generation\" and highly criticized the sword-fighting choreography.[22] Vincent Canby of The New York Times felt the story structure was not well balanced, feeling Spielberg depended too much on art direction.[23] Hal Hinson of The Washington Post was one of few who gave the film a positive review. Hinson elaborated on crucial themes of children, adulthood and loss of innocence. However, he observed that Spielberg \"was stuck too much in a theme park world\".[24]Hook was nominated for five categories at the 64th Academy Awards. This included Best Production Design (Norman Garwood, Garrett Lewis) (lost to Bugsy), Best Costume Design (lost to Bugsy), Best Visual Effects (lost to Terminator 2: Judgment Day), Best Makeup (lost to Terminator 2: Judgment Day) and Best Original Song (\"When You're Alone\", lost to Beauty and the Beast).[25] Hook lost the Saturn Award for Best Fantasy Film to Aladdin, in which Robin Williams co-starred,[26] while cinematographer Dean Cundey was nominated for his work by the American Society of Cinematographers.[27] Dustin Hoffman was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy (lost to Robin Williams for The Fisher King).[28] John Williams was given a Grammy Award nomination for Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media;[29] Julia Roberts received a Golden Raspberry Award nomination for Worst Supporting Actress (lost to Sean Young as the dead twin in A Kiss Before Dying).[30]In 2011, Spielberg told Entertainment Weekly: \"There are parts of Hook I love. I'm really proud of my work right up through Peter being hauled off in the parachute out the window, heading for Neverland. I'm a little less proud of the Neverland sequences, because I'm uncomfortable with that highly stylized world that today, of course, I would probably have done with live-action character work inside a completely digital set. But we didn't have the technology to do it then, and my imagination only went as far as building physical sets and trying to paint trees blue and red.\"[31] Spielberg gave a more blunt assessment in a 2013 radio show appearance: \"I wanna see Hook again because I so don't like that movie, and I'm hoping someday I'll see it again and perhaps like some of it.\"[32]","title":"","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/0e/Hook_poster_transparent.png/220px-Hook_poster_transparent.png","developer":"","genre":""},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Humans","description":"The Humans is a puzzle game published and released by GameTek in 1992. The goal of The Humans varies per level, but is usually to bring at least one of the player-controlled humans to the designated end area, marked by a red tile. To do this, the player must take advantage of the humans' ability to build a human ladder and use tools, such as spears, torches, wheels, ropes, in later levels, a witch doctor.[1]The Humans was released for many different consoles, with the Jaguar and Lynx versions, published by Atari, titled Evolution: Dino Dudes and Dinolympics respectively.[2] Two sequels have been released, \"The Humans 2: The Jurassic Levels\" for Amiga and PC and \"The Humans III: Evolution- Lost in Time\" for Amiga (AGA) and PC.[3] In 2009, it was rereleased for Windows under the name \"The Humans: Meet the Ancestors!\"[4] Upon its release, The Humans was received very well, praised for its originality and decent graphics and music.[5]The Humans is a puzzle game whose objective is to manipulate the given number of humans, taking advantage of abilities and tools, to achieve the level's goal, usually consisting of finding a certain tool, killing a certain number of dinosaurs, or bringing at least one human to the end point, marked by a conspicuous red tile. Each level is independent of the next, each with its own tools, goal, and set number of humans allowed per level. The only things that carry from level to level are the total number of humans in the player's tribe and the player's total score.[6]The Humans is modeled after Psygnosis's Lemmings series of games in that it is a timed puzzle game that requires the player to make each individual perform different tasks to achieve one goal, but differs in that it gives direct control of individual humans to the player, rather than only allowing the player to simply assign tasks. GameTek released this game in 1992, shortly after Lemmings was released hoping to capitalize the popularity of this style of game. The Humans also derives its pre-game screen, featuring a code that may be used to reach that particular level, used by both Lemmings as well as Populous.[7]Following the success of the original release, an expansion pack containing 80 additional levels was released in 1992 under the name \"Humans 2: The Jurassic Levels\"in the UK and \"The Humans: Insult to Injury\" in the United States. in 1993, the two games were combined and released for both Amiga and DOS under the name \"Humans 1 and 2\"[8] and included English, French, German, Italian and Spanish versions. The DOS was distributed on a CD-ROM and was improved in several ways, including adding a save game feature so the player could quit, then restart at a later time. In 1995, GameTek released The Humans 3: Evolution- Lost in Time for Amiga and DOS. The third installment keeps to the original game idea, but differs from the original in storyline, gameplay style, and level continuity.[9]About a decade after GameTek declared bankruptcy, The Humans was upgraded and rereleased by Deep Silver for Windows under the name \"The Humans: Meet the Ancestors\".[4] This version kept the same general gameplay style, but improved the graphics and added more interactive objects and enemies.[10]The Amiga and PC versions of The Humans received excellent reviews, while those of versions ported to other consoles were more lukewarm. Ashley Cotter-Cairn, of Amiga Mania, gave the Amiga version an overall score of 93% and ranked it number 1 claiming \"The Humans has everything: great graphics, including a variety of backdrops, some neat sound...(she's) pleased to say that those long months at the keyboard were worth every second.\"[5] Computer Gaming World called the PC version of The Humans \"delightful\". While stating that the VGA graphics' limited color palette resembled those of a console game more than a computer's, it liked the soundtrack and documentation. The magazine concluded that while \"not quite the calibre of Lemmings ... In all, much pleasure is to be had\".[11]","title":"The Humans","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/01/The_Humans_-_cover_art_%28Amiga_CD32%29.jpg/256px-The_Humans_-_cover_art_%28Amiga_CD32%29.jpg","developer":"Imagitec Design","genre":"Puzzle"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hungry_Dinosaurs&action=edit&redlink=1","description":"Other reasons this message may be displayed:\n","title":"","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b4/Wiktionary-logo-en.png/28px-Wiktionary-logo-en.png","developer":"","genre":""},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hunt_for_Red_October_(console_game)","description":"The Hunt for Red October is a video game based on the movie The Hunt for Red October.

The series first aired in 1993 and ended in 1997.The series focused on a fictional soccer team headed by the female inheritor of the teams' legacy, Amanda Carey and their coach, Jock Stone. Stone was notably based on Celtic F.C. manager Jock Stein. During the series, the Hurricanes soccer team would either be battling a renegade soccer club, The Gorgons managed by Stavros Garkos, for pitch supremacy or having wild, unpredictable adventures off the field in exotic world touring locations.Despite such a lengthy episode number, and a cult following among British football fans who watched it faithfully in reruns during the football seasons, the Hurricanes remains a fairly dormant and minor addition to BKN's library, and its impact worldwide is barely minimum, its most memorable aspect being its theme song (\"We're the Hurricanes\").The program which had been aired as a Saturday morning cartoon show in the late 1990s on UPN network and sometimes on Sunday mornings after Sherlock Holmes and the 22nd Century, though it didn't see main stream broadcasting in the United States until the fall of 2012 when Cookie Jar Entertainment, which had acquired the BKN library through a bankruptcy in 2010, added the program to the weekday Cookie Jar-controlled \"This Is for Kids\" lineup on the This TV digital subchannel network.Amanda Carey is the 12-year-old owner of the Hurricanes. Inheriting the position after her father disappears, she is involved with the management of her soccer team rather than hiring another manager or selling the team. Unlike Stavros Garkos, Amanda always respects the integrity of the game and believes in fair play. She owns a Scottish Terrier named Dribble who serves as one of the team's mascots.Jock Stone is the wise but no-nonsense Scottish head coach of the Hurricanes. His main priority is soccer and he's not fond of when the team is late for or skips out on his training.Cal Casey: The Hurricanes' team captain from the United States. If the team faces a problem outside of soccer or if the Gorgons are up to no good, Cal is usually there to help set things right.Plato Quiñones: A naive Brazilian who believes in superstitions like vampires. He does not wear footwear and plays soccer barefoot. In the episode \"Go Ape!\", Plato smuggles a monkey he named Topper into stadium and he becomes Plato's pet and one of the team's mascots.Napper Thompson: An Englishman who enjoys poetry and sci-fi stories. Tends to get into more strange situations than the others. In \"Traitor\", Garkos has a transmitter unknowingly put in his filling so he can steal secrets from the Hurricanes. In \"Lord Napper of Stepney\". Napper inherited his Uncle's fortune on the condition he never plays soccer ever again. In \"The Great Defensive Wall of China\", a cult believes Napper is \"the one\". Is usually seen hanging out with Cal.Helmut Beethoven and Jorg Beethoven: German twins who despite being confident in their abilities as the team's strikers, often feud with each other. Helmut is slimmer, taller and insists on being the driver of the team bus. Jorg is shorter, more muscular and wears a distinctive headband.Stats Hiro: The team's right-midfielder hailing from Japan. He's the smallest and one of the most agile members. He is very intelligent and mechanically inclined creating a flying camera called the Flying Eye and a high-tech \"computer-'bot\" called MATT (Multimedia Analysis and Training Toolkit). In \"Team Spirit\" he injured his leg and was replaced in their game against the Eagles with Little Bear.Dino Allegro: The Italian goalie of the team. Dino kept a picture of his brother in his bag to look at before every match. Garkos discovered this and had Rebo take it crushing his confidence. It took a visit from his brother to get his head back in the game. He is also afraid of space and flying in a space shuttle.Oliver Marley, also known as Rude, is a player from Jamaica. He was a high school drop-out, until \"Marley in Chains\" where he gets his high school certificate after encouragement from Napper who also didn't finish school.Georgie Wright: An English footballer who always calls the coin toss at the start of the match. He cannot swim and is afraid or large bodies of water because of it.Papillon: The team's talented, French striker with a one word name similar to Pelé. He has an eye for the ladies and has an overall suave personality. He also likes driving fast cars and racing.Toro Contrais: A bulky player from Spain who is slightly overconfident on the field. When Jock temporarily suspends him, Toro becomes a pro-wrestler named \"The Masked Matador\".Andy Stone: Son of Jock Stone, Andy is the team's physician. He created a revolutionary cold-compress which he used in a game against Zambia.The Gorgons are a team of violent players who usually utilize illegal tactics inside or outside the field. Their headquarters is inside a volcano in the Island of Garkos. The team includes:Stavros Garkos is the villain who owns the Garkos Gorgons, a football team of thugs who often use dirty tricks not only to defeat the Hurricanes, but also help Stavros Garkos in other dirty schemes. He is voiced by Jay Brazeau. He runs Garkos Enterprises and is known for using the name Medusa as a pseudonym for some of his companies and breaking Medusa-head staffs during moments of anger.Stavros Garkos is the most persistent of the villains from Hurricanes. In most of his appearances, he tries to steal the Hurricanes' status as worlds greatest football team and/or make large sums of money. Garkos' interests also include damaging the Hurricanes' image (even when he doesn't seem to gain anything from this) and his attempts in 'proving' football as a Greek sport.Stavros Garkos holds many companies around the world. Even though it was never stated which ones are branches of Garkos Enterprises and which ones are not. Stavros Garkos also owns an unnamed insurance company that covers the above-mentioned satellite. Garkos Enterprises has an office in London, even though it was unclear which kind of activities he develops there.Wyn Smithe and Genghis Khan: Wyn and Genghis are Stavros Garkos' best players, and are the ones most often enlisted to assist Stavros with his schemes. It is rare to see the Gorgons playing without them both, except through injury, and even rarer to see one of them appearing in an episode without the other. One instance of this occurring is in When Hurricanes Collide, when Genghis appeared but Wyn did not.[citation needed] Even though Stavros favours them, they have little loyalty in return; they once attempted to steal a gold mine so as to be able to stop working for Stavros.[citation needed]Rebo: Rebo's biggest role in Stavros Garkos's dirty schemes was in Blood Match, when Rebo stole Dino Allegro's lucky charm, damaging his abilities as the Hurricanes's main goalkeeper. He also makes a cameo helping Wyn and Genghis to keep the Hurricanes from playing a fund-raiser game to save Inverfinnan Park, home to Jock Stone's former team Inverfinnan Celtics (a spoof of Celtic FC of Scotland), from being bought by Garkos. Most of Rebo's other appearances is simply playing football.Benny the Viking: This unpopular Swede is hated by his fellow patriots for his dirty play. Stavros Garkos tries to revert it by hiring a publicist who puts Benny to compete against Cal Casey on a game show where Casey not only defeats Benny, but also teaches him the value of good sportsmanship. A lesson that he only practices at his home country, this enhancing his popularity for a price Stavros Garkos didn't like to pay.Lobo: Lobo was once nominated for the title of Spain's best football player. His rival for the title was Toro, from the Hurricanes. To help his player to get the title, Stavros Garkos kidnaps Toro's sister, Maria, as part of a plan to ruin his popularity.Stavros Garkos sometimes enlists the help of some relatives for some dirty tactics. Here we have some of them:Spiro Garkos: Stavros's brother. Spiro is nowhere to be seen without a uniform and on his very first appearance he's called by Amanda a \"mister-in-charge-of-everything\". What could be noticed from his first appearance in Stowaway, when he was revealed to be the coach of the Gorgons' Youth Team, the Police Chief of the Island of Garkos and the head of Child Welfare. In Around the World in 90 Minutes, Spiro is the admiral of the Garkon Navy and helped his brother to take over the aircraft carrier the Hurricanes were using to play football at sea. He also makes a cameo appearance in There's Only One Jock Stone as captain of Stavros Garkos's cruise ship.Melinda Garkos: Stavros's sister. Melinda helps her brother in anything he wants to, no matter how low she has to get. Her low acts include making people ruined by Stavros Garkos sell their homes to him (Water, Water, Everywhere), stealing artifacts from ancient Egyptian Pyramids (Serpents of the Nile), passing herself as the legendary Medusa (The curse of the gorgon), and helping the Gorgons to forge evidence to blackmail referees on Dino's snapshoot.Irena Bole: Stavros's niece. Stavros Garkos had a scheme involving a childhood friend of Cal Casey. This friend had criminal records and is now a goalkeeper for the L.A. Lasers. Irena only agreed to help her uncle in exchange of becoming the first female vice-president of Garkos Enterprises. When the plan fails, Garkos says he wouldn't hire her even as a coffee-lady. Since she's single (she's called Ms.) and doesn't bear the name Garkos, we can assume Spiro and Melinda aren't Stavros Garkos's only siblings.Stavros Garkos IV: Stavros's namesake and look-alike great-grandson from the future. Stavros Garkos had mortgaged all his companies to bet against the Hurricanes and lost. Because of that, all Stavros IV inherited was his football team. To revert this situation, Stavros IV sends a robot player named The Relegator to change the game results. Stavros Garkos was reluctant about this because he couldn't have a great-grandson for not even having grandchildren, as he stated, but he started believing when the bet (something he never expected to meet someone who already knew about) was mentioned. For a final test, Garkos asks the Relegator what he thinks about rules and he says they must be broken, this making Stavros believe he's been sent by a Garkos. The robot fails and the Plan B destroys a factory, forcing Garkos to pay for the damages, creating an alternate future where Stavros IV washes the Hurricanes's uniforms. Since this was a dream of Napper Thompson, it doesn't affect the continuity of the series. Dream or not, this is, so far, the strongest clue pointing Stavros Garkos as a father of at least one child.Stavros Garkos holds many companies around the world. Even though it was never stated which ones are branches of Garkos Enterprises and which ones are not, here we can see a list of these companies:Gorgon World: A nightmarish theme park Stavros Garkos has built in L.A. by destroying Cal Casey's neighborhood. Garkos intended to destroy a Sports Centre where underprivileged kids could learn soccer, so he could build a parking lot for his park. The park and this story took place in Home Game. It was never revealed if Garkos ever opened this park, or what happened to it.Garkos International Holding: First (or only) mentioned in Hot Dog, this holding company holds The Hotel Jasper, where Stavros Garkos tried to frame Rude Marley. It's unknown what else is held by Garkos International Holding.Medusa Arms Hotel: Only seen in Target: Winston, this is, according to Amanda, the hotel where the Gorgons go to sleep when they are in Hispanola. It was never said if the hotel belongs to Garkos or not, but the name \"Medusa\" and its connections to the Gorgons make us assume it does belong to him.Medusa Gold-Mining Company: First seen in Team Spirit, Garkos utilized it to extract gold from a piece of land stolen from Native Americans.Garkos Finance Company: In Techno-Team, this company helped Stavros Garkos to take over Walker Laboratories when its former owner, Mickey Walker, had missed the deadline to pay the mortgage.Medusa Network: Objecting to have a Television network that would show sport events around the world, Stavros Garkos opened Medusa Network in When Hurricanes Collide. When Garkos tried to use its satellite to destroy a space station where five of the Hurricanes were located, Dino lets the satellite loose in space. It is unclear if Garkos ever placed it back on its original orbit or not.Stavros Garkos also owns an unnamed insurance company that covers the above-mentioned satellite.In Ecosphere of Death, Stavros Garkos gambles against a casino owner named Jackson Black and wins Black's ecosphere[disambiguation needed]. Part of the deal was that every time Garkos won, Black would have a chance to recover what he lost. So, Black made a bet against the Gorgons. The Hurricanes won the game and Garkos had to return the ecosphere.In The Flying Eye, Garkos tried to force relatives of Amanda Carey out of their land so he would open a water park developed by Garkos Enterprises.Garkos Enterprises has an office in London, even though it was unclear which kind of activities he develops there.Note: Edit this list with the names of the teams from their corresponding countries","title":"","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/ae/The_Hurricanes_%28animated_series_-_box_cover_art%29.jpg","developer":"","genre":""},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyper_V-Ball","description":"","title":"Super Volley II\nHyper V-Ball","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/5b/HypervballSNES_boxart.jpg/220px-HypervballSNES_boxart.jpg","developer":"","genre":"Traditional volleyball"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyper_Zone","description":"Hyper Zone (ハイパーゾーン, HaipāZōn?) is a shooter video game developed by HAL Laboratory, Inc. for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) video game console. It was one of the first games to be released for the console and is notably one of the few \"3D scrolling shooter\" types available. Like many of the system's earlier releases, Hyper Zone used the SNES' mode 7 capability.Hyper Zone's gameplay is a cross between a racing and shooter game. The object of the game is to navigate each level while shooting enemies and earning points until finally an encounter with a boss enemy ends each level. After enough points are acquired, the player earns an extend and their ship is upgraded at the beginning of the next stage. The player's ship can receive up to six upgrades.Hyper Zone contains eight levels totally. After the initial game is finished, it restarts from the beginning with the player continuing in their final ship and keeping score; the game loops infinitely.Hyper Zone has a resemblance to Eliminator, a game released for the Amiga and various 8-Bit computers.[original research?] The game's perspective and its unusual landscapes were inspired by the \"Star Gate\" sequence of 2001: A Space Odyssey (film).[citation needed] The offtrack landscape in the Material Factory (Area 1 in the US/European version, Area 3 in the Japanese version) is a tessellation of flashing tetrominos that resemble those in Tetris; the boss in Area 3 resembles the right part of the SNES controller, and buttons—of the same four colors as the Japanese and PAL region SNES logo—circle around it. Another HAL game, Kirby's Dream Land 3, references this game: The final area in the game is called Hyperzone, and several other areas share names.The Japanese version is called Hyper Zone, and its logotypes in and out of the game differ from those in the western version. Levels 1 and 3 underwent a graphics swap between the two versions: the level layout and enemy positioning (aside from each boss encounter) is still the same, but the graphics set and background music are different. It is unknown why this was done because levels 1 and 3 have bosses that do not fit into their respective color schemes in the western versions.The Hyper Zone soundtrack, composed by Jun Ishikawa, consists of fourteen tracks.","title":"Hyper Zone","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8f/HyperZone_box_art.JPG/250px-HyperZone_box_art.JPG","developer":"HAL Laboratory","genre":"Rail shooter"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ignition_Factor","description":"","title":"Fire Fighting\nThe Ignition Factor","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/32/The_Ignition_Factor_Box.jpg/220px-The_Ignition_Factor_Box.jpg","developer":"Jaleco","genre":"Action"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illusion_of_Gaia","description":"","title":"Illusion of Gaia (NA)\nIllusion of Time (EU)","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/1a/Iogbox.jpg/220px-Iogbox.jpg","developer":"Quintet","genre":"Action RPG"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperium_(1992_video_game)","description":"Imperium (Armored Maneuverer Dion [機動装甲 ダイオン] in Japan) is a vertical scrolling Shooter developed by Vic Tokai in 1992 for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System system.Taking place in the year 2027, Earth is suddenly attacked by the planetoid space fortress Zektron. Many cities are decimated and occupied by the Zektron forces, threatening to annihilate humanity. An underground military squadron and lab develops a small mecha called Dion (Imperium in the US version) aboard the mothership Leinoa, a mecha capable of harnessing great firepower. The human's goal is to send Dion/Imperium into Zektron and destroy it only after the Earth occupation forces have been eliminated.Imperium differs from most shooters in many ways. There is no high score counter, but instead an experience points counter is displayed. Players earn experience points by destroying multitudes of enemies and the numbers differ depending on the size of the enemy. Players then earn additional weapons and power-ups for each weapon through a set number of experience points. The player has a five-hit life bar. If a player takes a hit, then whatever weapon they were using when they were hit is down graded by one point. Players can replenish health and any downgraded weapon by earning back experience points. The player also has speed-change control, which they can use change the speed of their mech to five different levels. The player has no lives. If the player dies, then it's Game Over.

From 2004 on however, a new series of animated shorts involving the crash dummies was produced and the action figures subsequently revived under the Hot Wheels brand, another subdivision of Mattel.The Crash Dummies are anthropomorphic action figures modeled after the mannequins used in automobile collision simulations. Each one generally has two \"impact buttons\" on their torsos that, when pushed, will spring their limbs from their bodies.The toys mostly focused on a single body type, which featured two chest buttons- the top button caused the head and arms to separate, and the bottom button forced the legs to come off. Each arm and leg could also be separated further. This body type did have problems, however, in that the small metal clips inside the bodies which held the limbs on would sometimes break. Further, the tabs which held the limbs on the bodies were made from an unreliable plastic and, thus, were prone to breakage. Other bodies, however, focused on character-specific features and, while retaining the removable limbs (each would pull off at the midpoint), the button would activate some other feature (i.e. Daryl's spinning head, Spare Tire's \"bug-out\" eyes, ears, and tongue).A set of vehicles was also released which could then be used to simulate the car crashes as seen in the ads of the original crash test dummies. Among others, these vehicles include cars, jeeps, motorcycles and even aeroplanes. Each toy can be destroyed in a similar manner as the Crash Dummies themselves and can then later be reassembled. Vehicles come equipped with appropriate safety features such as helmets, airbags, and working seatbelts to promote saving lives through their use.The original line of Crash Dummy toys centered on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's Vince and Larry \"spokes-dummies\" and other characters. The concept and initial play pattern for action figures and crash cars evolved through collaboration of Brian Dyak and Lawrence Scot Deutchman of the Entertainment Industries Council, Inc. as a key component of a national cause oriented marketing campaign designed by them and Leisure Concepts Ltd. Mr. Dyak and Mr. Deutchman hold the original inventor rights. However, licensing rights were given to Leisure Concepts and subsequently Tyco Toys shared in ownership. The campaign successfully went beyond the traditional television and radio public service announcements to give children and parents a hands on experience to learn the message \"buckle up\". Dummy suits used the characteristic solid colors and \"caution\" checkered stripes. The first generation was called \"Vince & Larry, The Crash Dummies\". Each toy was accompanied with a personalized biography card explaining the characteristics of each character. The first generation figures had the slogan \"You Could Learn A Lot From A Dummy, Buckle Your Safety Belt!\". After the first generation the slogan changed to \"Don't You Be A Dummy. Buckle Your Safety Belt!\". Later on as the characters developed, this line was added by the dummies saying, \"And leave the crashing to us!\" Deutchman developed the original style guide and Dyak led negotiations with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, eventually resulting in the flexibility to expand the line by discontinuing the relationship with the government. This catapulted the toy line into the popular culture as Leisure Concepts secured over fifty licensed properties on behalf of the campaign, including a Saturday morning television special.The bright primary color packaging with what would become the trademark neon orange accented designs were executed for Tyco by Howard Temner Design of New York, who contracted veteran toy and video game illustrator Marc Ericksen to do the myriad illustrations that would be featured throughout the production run of these popular toys. This team worked together with Tyco on all the following toy sets, from Vince and Larry, all the way through the Junk Bot series and their various iterations, eventually including their licensed uses for video game applications.The Incredible Crash Dummies saw a departure from the NHTSA dummies after three major networks banned the PSA commercials on airwaves in fear of promotion of Tyco's line of toys. This led to the end of the Vince and Larry action figures and namesake and the creation of a specific set of new heroes, Slick and Spin. Other characters carried over from the original series included Daryl, Spare Tire, and Hubcat & Bumper, the crash test cat and dog. However, all sets were re-branded with the new logos and characters. All artwork and images on the packages remained the same, with the names of Vince and Larry painted out in every photo. Each character came equipped with his own accessories and special ability to spring apart. Others had customized vehicles to drive around in. The Crash Dummies' profession is to educate children on the dangers of traffic and the hazards of driving without a seat belt. According to the backstory, they spend their time at the Crash Test Facility improving safety of automobiles by means of elaborate crash simulations. The backstory of Slick and Spin is identical to Vince & Larry's, as are their artwork with a palette swap. Axel (Green suit with glasses), Dash (Yellow suit with bulls eye on forehead), Wack (Red shirt with suspenders, blue pants and blue cap), Flip (Black and yellow suit), and J.R. (Red and gray suit) are only included with vehicles and could not be purchased separately, giving them a high rarity. By \"The Incredible\" era, the line had gained mainstream popularity in the USA and Europe, and quickly became a target for angry letters from parents. Many questioned the glorification of car crashes, while others protested the removal of Skid the Kid and Hubcat/Bumper from stores, which eventually happened.The Junkbots were created as the primary antagonists to the Crash Dummies. They are four ruthless killing machines - the sinister leader Junkman and his henchmen Piston Head, Jack Hammer and Sideswipe - bent on destroying the Crash Dummies. Contrary to the original toys the Junkbots could not be blown apart (though parts were still removable), and they were mainly equipped with weapons intended to activate the triggers on the Crash Dummies' bodies. The junkbots were also supplied with their own set of vehicles, including a snow plower, a cannon and a chopper styled motorcycle. In this generation the Crash Dummies were released with bright colors, supposedly wearing \"Pro-Tek\" uniforms that made them stronger and faster. Three new dummies are originally released, Bull, who is presented as a friend to Spare Tire, and Dent & Chip, two brothers who always sport giant smiles and have gashes in their skulls, exposing pieces of brain. Each action figure comes with a weapon or tool to fight the Junkbots. In addition the Crash Go-Kart, Crash ATV, and Crash Lawn Mower were re-released with the same artwork on the packaging, but without including an action figure. The photographs on the boxes were re-shot using Pro-Tek action figures such as Daryl. Later in the year a fourth new dummy, Ted, was released wearing a black and green suit and coming with a VHS copy of the Incredible Crash Dummies computer animated cartoon.On the back of the packaging of the two figures released with the special Crash Dummies VHS, were pictures showing figures to be released in the next series of toys (in 1994). These were never publicly released in North America, though North American figures of Slick, Spin, Axel, and Dash with \"The Incredible\" on card do exist and are ultra rare, they either received a limited regional release, or are unsold factory stock, it is not fully known, but once in a blue moon North American carded figures from North America that were fully ready for retail do appear on eBay. Also complete and incomplete figures from factory stock sealed in plastic bags exist and are collectors pieces. It is unknown how many Darlene, the female dummy, prototypes were made, but they do exist, some finished and some unfinished, unpainted shells. She was intended as a female counterpart to Daryl, and featured breasts, a feminine head with a bow and ribbon, and a pink wrench. Though never released as a figure, she was featured in the board game under the name Darla. In the board game, she did not have a pro-tek suit, but rather a pink suit in the style of the first line of toys. A pro tek figure of the controversial Skid the Kid with a new stroller was also slated, made it to prototype stage, but it was never released anywhere, and is even rarer than the Darlene prototype. It can also be seen on the packaging of Ted and Gold Junkman action figures. South America and Europe, had a limited release of some of the items in the line. The line was to continue with the Pro-Tek series, re-introducing characters that had once been included with vehicles from the original line of toys, but their action buttons performed actions previously unseen in the first two lines of figures. In addition, a new line called Crash Dummies Racing was released in small quantities. Racing vehicles and accompanying characters in racing gear were announced but only some ever made it to stores, mostly outside of North America. The true release status of anything from 1994 is almost impossible to determine. Many more ideas had made it to final evaluation but were dropped when Tyco ceased production of the line. Slick, Splin, Dent, and Chip were all released in the Reacing series line. Three additional figures were set to be released but there is no evidence they were ever put into production. Rod, Gasket, and Axel were seen in very rare advertisements as well as on the back of the Racing series cards. The only known figures are prototypes and are very rare.After purchasing Tyco Toys in 1998, Mattel revived the Crash Dummies line under the Hot Wheels toy brand. The release this time was similar to the original motif: living dummies crash-testing vehicles. The four Dummies were Crash, Crunch, Splice and Gyro. Unlike the first generation, each one suffered damage from crashes in a different way. Crash fell apart like the majority of the original figures, Crunch's head could be bashed into his body, Splice split in two whenever he was involved in a crash, Gyro's upper and lower halves spun in opposite directions. Two others followed the four, Poppa and Flex. Poppa's upper half came of the leg followed by his eyes popping out and Flex bent over backwards.In 1993, a half-hour television special called The Incredible Crash Dummies was produced. It was aired on Fox Kids on May 1, 1993. The animated short was entirely composed of computer generated imagery and centered on the adventures of Slick and Spin. A fellow Dummy named Ted has been chosen to use a new, indestructible torso module (Torso-9000), but his head is mixed up with an evil dummy's head, leading to the birth of Junkman. Slick and Spin try to free the kidnapped Dr. Zub from Junkman before the villain can extract the knowledge of how to mass-produce the torso. The special was later released on video and sold with the \"Ted\" action figure from the special as well as a second edition recolored Junkman.In 2004, a series of \"Crash Dummies\" animated shorts were commissioned for the FOX network and produced by 4Kids Entertainment. About a year later after it first aired, the graphics of the shorts were changed. The characters looked slightly darker, while the frame rate of the shorts were slightly slower. In this series, the dummies were named Crash, Splice, Crunch, and Gyro. In the fall of 2005, they were replaced by Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles shorts.A video game also called The Incredible Crash Dummies was developed by Gray Matter Inc. and published by LJN, Ltd. in 1993 for Super Nintendo and the NES. The game was ported to numerous systems including the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis and the Commodore Amiga. It was awarded Strangest License of 1992 by Electronic Gaming Monthly.[2] The game received generally negative reviews, with critics commenting that the controls are poor and the novelty factor quickly wears out.[3][4]In the game, the player takes control of Slick in a storyline loosely tied in with the animated movie. The crash dummy is sent on a quest to recover the Torso 9000 and defeat the Junkman. The game adopts a traditional side-scrolling playing style in which each level must be finished from left to right and Junkman's minions defeated along the way. Whenever Slick suffers damage he loses a limb, until he has none left and loses a life. The loss of limbs does not otherwise affect gameplay. He can recover lost limbs by collecting screwdrivers.In total there are sixteen levels to complete divided into four areas, each of which must be completed under a specified amount of time. To defend himself, Slick comes equipped with spanners he can throw at his enemies, although their supply is limited. At the end of each area a boss character must be fought and, when successfully completed, a bonus stage can be entered. In the bonus stage the player drives a crash test vehicle and rakes up bonus points as the speed rises.Master System, Game Boy and Game Gear games of the same name were also created. Unlike the SNES and Genesis games however, these versions put the Dummies in a more traditional role. Every level gave Slick and Spin some variety of dangerous stunt to do, which they would in turn be graded on style. There were 5 levels: jumping off a building, driving a car through a course, skiing down a mountain, sorting bombs in a bomb factory and piloting a spaceship. Once the player had completed these levels, they would repeat numerous times, but with a different layout each time and generally increasing in difficulty, until the player has earned enough money to go on holiday.A series of comics involving the Crash Dummies in pro-tek suits was also produced by Harvey Comics in November 1993.A set of three magazine sized comics were released by Citgo in 1992 featuring the dummies in their original suits. Scattered throughout the comics are various puzzles and games to complete.Each book is written and illustrated by Tony and Tony Tallarico.The final page of each book contains four coupons (expired November 1, 1992)Each book also features the 'Morgan Shepherd's Pledge For Life' Contest which required kids to mail in a certificate with their information and the signed statement \"I pledge to wear my seat belt at all times while riding in an automobile.\" Contest featured 1,105 winners drawn at random.","title":"","developer":"","genre":""},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Incredible_Hulk_(1994_video_game)","description":"The Incredible Hulk is a side-scrolling action video game released for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, Sega Genesis, Sega Master System, and Sega Game Gear.

Named Whatizit (What is it?) at its first introduction at the close of the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, the animated character with the ability to morph into different forms was a departure from the Olympic tradition in that it did not represent a nationally-significant animal or human figure.[citation needed]In 1991, the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games (ACOG) began a search for a mascot with a competition of twenty design firms as well as suggestions from the general public.[1] The selection, Whatizit, was designed by John Ryan, senior animation director of Atlanta-based design firm DESIGNefx.[2] Whatizit originally appeared as a blue, tear-shaped \"blob\" with rings around his eyes and tail. He wore high-top sneakers and had star-shaped pupils. His arms and legs were also short with a toothy grin showing both rows of teeth. He was later modified to have longer limbs to give a more athletic look.After a very critical reception to Whatizit's introduction during the closing ceremonies of the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, ACOG began work to reshape the character specifically focusing on children, who were far more attracted to the character than adults.His greatest change came about after he lost the bottom row of teeth and gained a nose. He was then referred to as Izzy. Also, his tongue became visible, and his limbs became longer, skinnier, and more athletic in appearance.[citation needed]ACOG commissioned an animated television special entitled \"Izzy's Quest For Olympic Gold\" to promote Izzy and expand his backstory. Produced by Film Roman, the special aired on TNT on August 12, 1995.[3]Despite continued efforts to evolve his look, Izzy proved very unpopular; a range of nicknames appeared in media outlets, such as \"The Sperm in Sneakers.\"[4] Busch Gardens Williamsburg, a theme park in Williamsburg, Virginia, named a new Wild Mouse roller coaster after the mascot, but the name has since been changed. A popular joke that circulated in Atlanta around the end of the 1996 games stated that the blue line painted on Peachtree Road (which actually designated the route for the Olympic Marathon) was \"Izzy's ass being dragged out of town.\"[citation needed]He was also the star of his very own video game called Izzy's Quest for the Olympic Rings.[5] It was released for the Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis systems.[6] An adventure game entitled Izzy's Adventure was released for PC in 1996.","title":"","developer":"","genre":""},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J.R.R._Tolkien%27s_The_Lord_of_the_Rings,_Vol._I_(SNES_video_game)","description":"J.R.R.

He is widely regarded as the greatest professional golfer of all time, winning a total of 18 career major championships, while producing 19 second place and 9 third place finishes in them, over a span of 25 years.[1] Nicklaus focused on the major championships (Masters Tournament, U.S. Open, Open Championship, and PGA Championship), and played a selective schedule of regular PGA Tour events, yet still finished with 73 victories, third on the all-time list.After winning two U.S. Amateurs in 1959 and 1961, and challenging for the 1960 U.S. Open (he finished in second place, two shots behind winner Arnold Palmer), Nicklaus turned professional toward the end of 1961. The 1962 U.S. Open was both Nicklaus' first major championship victory and his first professional win. This win over Arnold Palmer began the on-course rivalry between the two. In 1966, Nicklaus won the Masters Tournament for the second year in a row, becoming the first golfer to achieve this, and also won The Open Championship, completing his career slam of major championships.[2] At age 26, he became the youngest to do so at the time. In 1968 and 1969, Nicklaus did not win a major tournament. He then won another Open Championship in 1970.[2]Between 1971 and 1980, he would win a further nine major championships, overtake Bobby Jones' record of 13 majors, and become the first player to complete double and triple career slams of golf's four professional major championships. At the age of 46, Nicklaus claimed his 18th and final major championship at the 1986 Masters Tournament, becoming that championship's oldest winner. Nicklaus joined the Senior PGA Tour (now known as the Champions Tour) in January 1990, when he became eligible, and by April 1996 had won 10 of the tour's tournaments, including eight of that tour's major championships, despite playing a very limited schedule. He continued to play at least some of the four regular Tour majors until 2005, when he made his final appearances at The Open Championship and the Masters Tournament.Nicklaus has also taken part in various off-course activities, including golf course design, charity work and book writing. Nicklaus is a member of the American Society of Golf Course Architects and has helped design courses such as Harbour Town Golf Links. Nicklaus also runs his own tournament on the PGA Tour, the Memorial Tournament. His golf course design company is one of the largest in the world. Nicklaus' books vary from instructional to autobiographical, with his Golf My Way considered one of the best instructional golf books of all time; the video of the same name is the best selling golf instructional to date.Nicklaus was born in the Columbus, Ohio suburb of Upper Arlington, Ohio and is of German descent, the son of pharmacist Charlie Nicklaus (who ran several sites named Nicklaus Drug Store) and his wife Helen. Charlie was a skilled all-round athlete, who had played college football for The Ohio State University Buckeyes, and had gone on to play semi-professional football under an assumed name for the Portsmouth Spartans (which later became the NFL's Detroit Lions). Charlie had also been a scratch golfer and local tennis champion in his youth.[3][4]Nicklaus was raised in Upper Arlington, and attended Upper Arlington High School, whose nickname and mascot are called the Golden Bears. Nicklaus was an honorable mention All-Ohio selection in basketball as a shooting guard in his senior year, and received some recruiting interest from college basketball programs, including Ohio State. He also competed successfully during his youth in football, baseball, tennis, and track and field.[3][5]Nicklaus took up golf at the age of 10, scoring a 51 at Scioto Country Club for his first nine holes ever played. Charlie Nicklaus had joined Scioto that same year, returning to golf to help heal a volleyball injury. Jack Nicklaus was coached at Scioto by club pro Jack Grout, a Texas-developed contemporary of golf greats Byron Nelson and Ben Hogan; Grout had played quite successfully on the PGA Tour, and would become Nicklaus' lifelong golf instructor.[3] Nicklaus overcame a mild case of polio as a 13-year-old.[6]Nicklaus won the first of five straight[7] Ohio State Junior titles at the age of 12. At 13, he broke 70 at Scioto Country Club for the first time, and became that year's youngest qualifier into the U.S. Junior Amateur, where he survived three match-play rounds. He had earned a handicap of +3 at age 13, the lowest in the Columbus area.[3][4] Nicklaus won the Tri-State High School Championship (Ohio/Kentucky/Indiana) at the age of 14 with a round of 68, and also recorded his first hole-in-one in tournament play the same year. At 15, Nicklaus shot a 66 at Scioto Country Club, which was the amateur course record, and qualified for his first U.S. Amateur. He won the Ohio Open in 1956 at age 16, highlighted by a phenomenal third round of 64, competing against professionals. In all, Nicklaus won 27 events in the Ohio area from age 10 to age 17.In 1957, Nicklaus won the International Jaycee Junior Golf Tournament, having lost the previous year in a playoff. Nicklaus also competed in his first of 44 consecutive U.S. Opens that year, but missed the cut. In 1958 at age 18, he competed in his first PGA Tour event, the Rubber City Open, at Akron, Ohio, tying for 12th place after being just one out of the lead at the 36-hole mark,[8] and made the cut in the U.S. Open, tying for 41st place. Nicklaus also won two Trans-Mississippi Amateurs – in 1958 at Prairie Dunes Country Club and 1959 at Woodhill Country Club, with final match victories of 9 & 8 and 3 & 2, respectively. Also in 1959, Nicklaus won the North and South Amateur at Pinehurst, North Carolina and competed in three additional PGA Tour events, with his best finish being another 12th place showing at the Buick Open.While attending Ohio State University, he won the U.S. Amateur twice (1959, 1961), and an NCAA Championship (1961). In the 1959 U.S. Amateur, Nicklaus defeated two-time winner and defending champion Charles Coe in the final 36-hole match 1-up, with a birdie on the final hole.[9] This was significant not only because of Coe's proven ability as a player, but also because Nicklaus became the then-youngest champion in the modern era, second only to Robert A. Gardner, who won in 1909. In 1961, Nicklaus became the first player to win the individual title at the NCAA Championship and the U.S. Amateur in the same year. He was followed by Phil Mickelson (1990), Tiger Woods (1996), and Ryan Moore (2004). Nicklaus also won the NCAA Big Ten Conference Championship that year with a 72-hole aggregate of 283, while earlier claiming the Western Amateur in New Orleans. In his second and last U.S. Amateur win in 1961, Nicklaus convincingly defeated Dudley Wysong 8 & 6 at Pebble Beach in the 36-hole championship match. For the week, Nicklaus was 20 strokes under par, including 34 birdies and two eagles.At the 1960 U.S. Open, Nicklaus shot a two-under par 282, finishing second by two strokes to Arnold Palmer, who won the tournament with a final round charge of six-under-par 65. This score remains the lowest ever by an amateur in the U.S. Open. Nicklaus played the final 36 holes with Ben Hogan, who later remarked he had just played 36 holes with a kid who should have won by 10 shots. During the final 36 holes, Nicklaus was two-under-par, and never shot a single round above par during the entire tournament, the only entrant to do so. Nicklaus had led by two shots with six holes to play. In 1960, Nicklaus also tied for 13th in the Masters Tournament. He tied for fourth in the 1961 U.S. Open, three shots behind champion Gene Littler, having played the final 54 holes one under par. Each of these three major championship finishes designated Nicklaus as Low Amateur. However, Nicklaus' one-under-par 287 tied for seventh in the 1961 Masters Tournament, and was second that year only to Charles Coe's low amateur placing, when he tied for second with Arnold Palmer at seven-under par 281, one shot behind champion Gary Player.Nicklaus represented the United States against Great Britain and Ireland on winning Walker Cup teams in both 1959 and 1961, decisively winning both of his matches in each contest. On the 1959 trip to Britain, he also made his only attempt at the British Amateur, the world's oldest international amateur event, at Royal St George's Golf Club, reaching the quarterfinal round (top 8).[3] He was also a member of the victorious 1960 U.S. Eisenhower Trophy team, winning the unofficial individual title by 13 shots over teammate Deane Beman with a four-round score of 269, a record which still stands; this score was 18 shots lower than Ben Hogan's earlier U.S. Open aggregate of 287 at the same site (which had, however, been scored under much tougher conditions).[3][10] Nicklaus was named the world's top amateur golfer by Golf Digest magazine for three straight years, 1959–1961.Nicklaus attended Ohio State from 1957 to 1961. He majored in pre-pharmacy his first three years, with good grades, and intended to follow his father into that profession after graduation.[9][11] As his golf achievements mounted, Nicklaus changed his mind on his career path, switching programs to study insurance, as he planned at that stage to remain a career amateur in golf, and to make his living by selling insurance. For a time he worked in the insurance field while also attending college. He married Barbara Bash in July 1960,[12] and their first child (Jack Jr.) was born in September 1961, but as of late October, Nicklaus was still intent on becoming the first amateur to win the Masters Tournament.[13][14] In early November, he announced he was turning professional, to best support his family.[15][16] He wound up a few course hours short of graduating from college. Ohio State granted him an honorary doctorate in 1972.[3]Nicklaus began his professional career on the PGA Tour in 1962. While Nicklaus officially turned professional in late 1961, he debated heavily the idea of remaining an amateur in order to further emulate his idol, Bobby Jones. However, Nicklaus realized in order to be regarded the best, he would have to compete against the best and in greater frequency. Shortly after turning professional, Nicklaus' future agent, Mark McCormack was interviewed by Melbourne Age writer, Don Lawrence who inquired about the American golf scene. When McCormack described Nicklaus, Lawrence referred to the \"large, strong, and blond\" player as \"the Golden Bear,\" a nickname that would become synonymous with Nicklaus throughout his professional life. However, another possible origination of the name derives from the high school that Nicklaus attended in Upper Arlington, Ohio, which uses the mascot the Golden Bears for its sports teams. As mentioned above, Nicklaus played on several Golden Bear athletic teams, including captaining its 1956 state-champion golf squad, suggesting that McCormack may have adopted the name through Nicklaus' high school affiliation. Regardless, by 1963, the nickname had stuck.His first professional win came in his 17th start, defeating the heavily favored Arnold Palmer in a Sunday playoff at Oakmont for the 1962 U.S. Open. While the galleries were more than vocal in their support for Palmer, who had grown up in the area, Nicklaus won the playoff by three shots (71 to 74). In 90 holes, Nicklaus had only one three-putt green. The U.S. Open victory made Nicklaus the reigning U.S. Open and U.S. Amateur champion. In addition, at age 22, Nicklaus was the youngest U.S. Open champion since Bobby Jones won at age 21 in 1923, and he has remained the youngest winner since (although Francis Ouimet was the youngest winner of the U.S. Open at age 20 in 1913).[17] The U.S. Open win placed Nicklaus on the cover of Time magazine. This was also the beginning of the Nicklaus-Palmer rivalry, which attracted viewers to golf on television.[4]By the end of the year Nicklaus had picked up two more wins, those being the Seattle Open and the Portland Open back-to-back. In addition, he tied for third in his first attempt at the PGA Championship. Nicklaus completed 1962 with over $60,000 in prize-money, made 26 of 26 cuts with 16 top-10 finishes, placed third on the PGA Tour money list, and was named Rookie of the Year. He also won the inaugural staging of the World Series of Golf, a select-field event for the year's major champions, and collected another $50,000 (unofficial money) for that win.[7]In 1963, Nicklaus won two of the four major championships—the Masters and the PGA Championship. These victories made him the then-youngest winner of the Masters and third-youngest winner of the PGA Championship, and each win came in just his second year as a professional. Earlier in 1963, Nicklaus injured his left hip playing an approach shot from the rough—an injury that would manifest itself years later. Ironically, Nicklaus credits this injury with assisting him in altering his swing heading into the 1963 Masters, thus allowing him to play a draw more easily. Along with three other wins including the Tournament of Champions, he placed second to Arnold Palmer on the PGA Tour money list with just over $100,000.[7] He also teamed with Palmer to win the Canada Cup (now the World Cup of Golf) in France, representing the United States (this event was shortened to 63 holes due to heavy fog). Nicklaus also finished as low individual scorer for that event.Nicklaus's rise to fame so soon after turning professional brought him significant endorsement income off the golf course. These business opportunities were facilitated by Mark McCormack, who also managed Palmer and Gary Player. Golf was growing rapidly in popularity and media coverage during the early 1960s, led by the performances of these three star players, with Palmer's charging style and personal popularity making him the world's most marketable sports figure. This association was the start of the agency which became known as International Management Group, and IMG, after building a base in golf management, eventually expanded into other sports. The Palmer-Nicklaus-Player association developed into the so-called \"Big Three\" of Golf. McCormack set up a series of televised golf matches around the world amongst the three stars, known as Big Three Golf, in the early 1960s. Nicklaus left IMG in the early 1970s, to set up his own management agency, Golden Bear Inc.[4]Despite winning no majors in 1964 (he had three runner-up finishes), Nicklaus led the PGA Tour money list for the first time in his career by a slim margin of $81.13 over Palmer. At The Open Championship at St Andrews, Nicklaus set a new record for the lowest score in the final 36 holes with 66-68 in high winds (the first time in the championship's history that 70 had been broken in each of the last two rounds). This was not enough, however, to win the event; Nicklaus placed second to Tony Lema.[7] Nicklaus also set a record for the lowest final round score in the PGA Championship with a 64 (since broken by Brad Faxon in 1995 with a 63), but fell three shots short of champion Bobby Nichols and his record-setting 271 score. In 31 official worldwide events in 1964, Nicklaus achieved six victories, seven runners-up, placed in the top-five 21 times, the top-10 21 times, and had only one missed cut. Nicklaus and Palmer also defended their team title at the World Cup in Hawaii, with Nicklaus again finishing as low individual scorer.Nicklaus won the Masters in 1965 and 1966, becoming the first consecutive winner of this event, and the youngest two-time and three-time winner. He broke Ben Hogan's 72-hole scoring record of 274 from 1953 by compiling a new aggregate of 271 in the 1965 Masters Tournament, which while tied by Raymond Floyd in 1976, lasted until Tiger Woods shot 270 in 1997; Woods's score of 270 was achieved with significantly improved golf equipment on essentially the same-length golf course over which Nicklaus and Floyd scored 271. During this 1965 tournament, Nicklaus hit 62 of 72 greens in regulation, and had 123 putts, inclusive of just one three-putt green. This was good enough to win by nine shots over Arnold Palmer and Gary Player; this margin of victory was a record at the time, and it lasted until Woods won by 12 shots in 1997. The week's performance was highlighted by a third-round 64 that consisted of eight birdies and no bogeys. It was of this round that Nicklaus said, \"I had never before and have never since played quite as fine a complete round of golf in a major championship as I did in the third round of the 1965 Masters\". This round tied Lloyd Mangrum's record set in 1940 at Augusta National and remained in place until Nick Price shot 63 during the third round in 1986. It was at this time that Bobby Jones stated Nicklaus played a game with which he was unfamiliar; Jones called Nicklaus' result \"the greatest performance in all of golfing history.\"After his record performance in 1965, some minor changes were made to Augusta National to toughen the course. Between these modifications and the difficult 1966 weather, Nicklaus successfully defended his title with an even par aggregate of 288, 17 shots higher. He won in an 18-hole playoff over Gay Brewer and Tommy Jacobs by shooting a two-under-par 70. Nicklaus led the PGA Tour money list again in 1965 by a healthy margin over Tony Lema. Nicklaus and Lema formed the U.S. team for the World Cup, held in Madrid, Spain,[3] but could not defend the title, as South Africa won. In all, Nicklaus competed in 28 official worldwide events in 1965, accumulating five victories, seven runners-up, 19 top-5 finishes, 23 top-10 finishes, and zero missed cuts.In 1966, Nicklaus also won The Open Championship at Muirfield in Scotland under difficult weather conditions, using his driver just 17 times, because of very heavy rough. This was the only major he had failed to win up to that point. This win made him the youngest player, age 26 (his fifth year on Tour), and the only one after Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, and Gary Player (until Tiger Woods at age 24 in 2000, also during his fifth year on Tour) to win all four major championships, now known as the Career Slam. Nicklaus eventually accomplished the double career slam in 1971 and the triple career slam in 1978, winning all four majors two and three times, respectively. Nicklaus was part of another title for the U.S. in the World Cup in Japan. Nicklaus concluded 1966 playing 22 official worldwide events, with four victories, four runners-up, 14 top-5 finishes, 16 top-10 finishes, and zero missed cuts.In 1967, he won his second U.S. Open title at Baltusrol, breaking Hogan's 72-hole record by one shot with a 275.[7] During the four rounds, Nicklaus hit 61 of 72 greens in regulation. Nicklaus finished this record win with a dramatic 238-yard 1-iron shot, uphill into a breeze and light rain, to the 72nd green (an approximate 260-yard equivalent) and holing a 22-foot (6.7 m) birdie putt to close out a final nine of 30 and final round of 65 to beat Arnold Palmer by four shots. Nicklaus and Palmer were the only two players to break par for the week. He also finished runner up in The Open Championship and third in the PGA Championship, one shot out of a playoff between Don January and Don Massengale. For a third time, Nicklaus led the PGA Tour money list for 1967. Later that year, Nicklaus and Palmer teamed up for a 13-shot wire-to-wire World Cup victory in Mexico City. Nicklaus competed in 24 official worldwide events in 1967, with five victories, four runners-up, 14 top-5 finishes, 16 top-10 finishes, and one missed cut.After Nicklaus won the 1967 U.S. Open, he did not win another major championship until the 1970 Open Championship at the Old Course at St Andrews. Moreover, his highest finish on the Tour money list for the years 1968–70 was second; his lowest was fourth, his worst ranking on the list since turning professional. However, it should be noted that his fourth-place ranking in 1970 would have been elevated to second if The Open Championship winnings were included during that period in the official PGA Tour money list, as they are today. Nicklaus finished runner-up in both the 1968 U.S. Open (to new rival Lee Trevino) and the 1968 Open Championship (to old rival Gary Player).Nicklaus did not make his inaugural appearance in the Ryder Cup until 1969 at age 29; eligibility rules at the time required a minimum five-year PGA Tour membership before points could be counted for team qualification; rules have been relaxed significantly since.[18] In the 1969 Ryder Cup, the entire competition came down to the anchor singles match between Nicklaus and Tony Jacklin. At the par-5 17th hole with Nicklaus leading by the score of 1 up, Jacklin made a 35-foot (11 m) eagle putt to square the match. With the entire competition outcome riding on this match, Nicklaus made a five-foot par putt on the last hole before controversially conceding Jacklin's par putt, ensuring that this game, and the overall match, ended in a tie.[19] Afterwards United States team Captain Sam Snead said \"This is the greatest golf match you have ever seen in England\".[20]During this period, Nicklaus also let his physical condition decline somewhat, putting on some excess weight, which affected his stamina. Following the Ryder Cup, he significantly improved his condition in the fall of 1969 by losing 25 pounds (11 kg) in one month,[21] and his game started to return to top form.[18] In February 1970, Nicklaus' father, Charlie Nicklaus, died. Five months after this, Nicklaus won the 1970 Open Championship under difficult scoring conditions in Scotland where the wind howled up to 56 MPH, defeating fellow American Doug Sanders in an 18-hole playoff round in emotional fashion. On the 18th hole of the playoff, Nicklaus drove about 380 yards, through the par-4 green with a three-wood, and was forced to pitch back to the hole. His eagle pitch finished approximately eight feet short of the hole. Nicklaus threw his putter into the air after sinking the winning putt, as he was thrilled to have won the Open at the home of golf, St Andrews.[22] He describes this period in his life:\"I was playing good golf, but it really wasn't that big a deal to me one way or the other. And then my father passed away and I sort of realized that he had certainly lived his life through my golf game. I really hadn't probably given him the best of that. So I sort of got myself back to work. So '70 was an emotional one for me from that standpoint. ... It was a big boost.\"[23]Nicklaus also went on to capture the Piccadilly World Match Play Championship in 1970 with a 2 & 1 win over Lee Trevino in the championship match. In all for the year, Nicklaus competed in 23 official worldwide events, won four, placed in the top-5 10 times, and the top-10 in 14.Although Nicklaus' performance had declined somewhat during this period, he was still ranked as the #1 player in the world, for 10 straight years, beginning in 1968, on the McCormack's World Golf Rankings, which were introduced that year by sports agent Mark McCormack. These rankings, the first attempt to take into account results from professional tours around the world, were not official during that era, but they eventually evolved into the current Official World Golf Ranking, starting in 1986.With a two-shot win at the 1971 PGA Championship in February over Billy Casper, Nicklaus became the first golfer to win all four majors twice in a career.[7] In this championship, Nicklaus was the only player to break 70 consecutively in the first two rounds under windy conditions and finished at seven-under par 281. Nicklaus finished second twice and fifth in the remaining three major championships for the year. While he finished tied for second in the Masters with Johnny Miller, Nicklaus made a big enough impression on a young Nick Faldo (watching on TV in England) in order for Faldo to take up the game seriously.By the end of 1971, Nicklaus had won four additional PGA tournaments including the Tournament of Champions by eight shots and the National Team Championship with Arnold Palmer by six shots. With $244,490 in official PGA Tour earnings, Nicklaus established a new single season money record during the year. Nicklaus also claimed his third World Cup individual title in 1971, with help from a 63 in the third round. He also won the team competition with partner Lee Trevino by 12 shots. The year 1971 brought Nicklaus a victory in the Australian Dunlop International as well, punctuated by a course record 62 (his career low score in competition; one of three) in the second round. For the record, Nicklaus played in 23 official worldwide events in 1971, won eight, had 17 top-5 finishes, 20 top-10 finishes, and compiled a 5–1–0 record in that year's Ryder Cup competition.Nicklaus won the first two major championships of 1972 by three shots each in wire-to-wire fashion. He won the Masters and the U.S. Open, creating talk of a calendar-year Grand Slam. Nicklaus opened with a four-under par 68 at Augusta National and never looked back. He was the only player under par for the week as he and the field battled difficult scoring conditions. In the U.S. Open at Pebble Beach again under severe scoring conditions, Nicklaus struck a one-iron on the 218-yard par-three 17th hole during the final round into a stiff, gusty ocean breeze that hit the flagstick and ended up three inches from the cup. The U.S. Open was Nicklaus' 13th career major and tied him with Bobby Jones for career majors (although a different group of tournaments had been considered majors in Jones's time). This victory was also Nicklaus' 11th professional major, tying him with Walter Hagen, and made him the first player to win the U.S. Amateur and U.S. Open championships on the same golf course.Nicklaus won a total of seven tournaments during 1972, and was runner-up in a further three PGA Tour events. However, Nicklaus did not win the Grand Slam that year, as Lee Trevino repeated as the Open Championship winner (Nicklaus finished second, one shot behind), and Gary Player prevailed in the PGA Championship. Nicklaus closed out this remarkable year with a second of three consecutive Walt Disney World Golf Classic victories by shooting a 21-under par 267 to win by nine shots. He concluded 1972 by competing in 20 official worldwide events winning seven, placing second in four, and compiling 15 top-10 finishes.Bobby Jones' record of majors was soon broken when Nicklaus won the PGA Championship in August 1973 by four shots over Bruce Crampton for his 12th professional major (surpassing Hagen's mark of 11) and 14th overall when using the old-style configuration of Jones' day. In that year he won another six tournaments. When he won the 1973 Ohio King's Island Open, he became the first PGA Tour player to win a Tour event over a course which he designed himself. The PGA Player of the Year was awarded to Nicklaus for the third time, and the second year in a row. Nicklaus was also the first player to win over $300,000.00 in official money for a single season in 1972 at $320,542; he eclipsed that threshold again the following year with $308,362. The former total was $106,137 more than runner-up Lee Trevino. The latter total for the year 1973 catapulted Nicklaus over the $2 million career PGA Tour earnings mark, making him the first player to reach that milestone. Nicklaus teamed with Johnny Miller for another team title in the World Cup of Golf, held in Spain. For the year, Nicklaus competed in 20 official worldwide events and claimed seven victories, 14 top-five finishes, 17 top-10s, and compiled a 4–1–1 record in that year's Ryder Cup competition.Nicklaus' failure to win a major in 1974 was offset somewhat by winning the inaugural Tournament Players Championship and being named one of the 13 original inductees into the World Golf Hall of Fame.[24] Nicklaus said this honor was a \"nice memento\" after a \"disappointing season\".[25] Although he had no major championship victories in 1974, Nicklaus still achieved four top-10 finishes in the four events, three of which were in the top four, and placed second on the official money list behind Johnny Miller. While less than a stellar year, Nicklaus was able to claim two victories and 13 top-10 finishes in 20 official worldwide events.Nicklaus started off well in 1975: he won the Doral-Eastern Open, the Sea Pines Heritage Classic, and the Masters in consecutive starts. His Masters win was his fifth, a record he was to break eleven years later. In this tournament, Nicklaus made a 40-foot (12 m) putt on the 16th hole of the final round to all but secure his victory over Tom Weiskopf and Johnny Miller in a riveting final-round battle. He also won the PGA Championship in August at Firestone Country Club by two shots over Bruce Crampton for his fourth win. Having won the Masters and PGA Championship, Nicklaus missed a playoff for the U.S. Open by two shots and a playoff for Open Championship by one shot. His performance in 1975 resulted in his being named PGA Player of the Year for the fourth time, tying Ben Hogan, and he was also named ABC's Wide World of Sports Athlete of the Year. Nicklaus also captured his fourth Australian Open during the year. The year 1975 yielded Nicklaus six wins, 12 top-5 finishes, and 16 top-10 finishes in 18 official worldwide events.Nicklaus placed first on the PGA Tour money list again in 1976, despite competing in only 16 events, winning just two (Tournament Players Championship and World Series of Golf) – neither of them majors – and playing what he called \"hang-back-and-hope golf\".[26] The 1976 Tournament Players Championship saw Nicklaus set a championship record of 19-under par 269 for his second win in this event which remained in place until Greg Norman's 24-under-par 264 assault in 1994. He also won the PGA Player of the Year award for a record fifth time. Between 1972 and 1976 the only time he failed to win this award was 1974. The year 1976 also concluded an official streak of 105 consecutive cuts made on the PGA Tour (ending at the World Open), which began for Nicklaus in 1970. At the time this streak was second only to Byron Nelson's record of 113.The following year, 1977, was also majorless for Nicklaus, but he did achieve four top-10 finishes in the four events inclusive of two second and one third place finish – this being one shot out of the PGA Championship playoff between Lanny Wadkins and Gene Littler. Despite a brilliant final round 66 at the Masters, he finished second by two shots to Tom Watson. But his subsequent second-place finish behind Watson at the Open Championship at Turnberry created headlines around the world. In a one-on-one battle dubbed the \"Duel in the Sun,\" Nicklaus shot 65-66 in the final two rounds, only to be beaten by Watson, who scored 65-65. This event marked the first time 270 was broken in a major championship, and the third-place finisher Hubert Green scored 279. Nicklaus would later say:\"There are those in golf who would argue into next month that the final two rounds of the 1977 British Open were the greatest head-to-head golf match ever played. Not having been around for the first five hundred or so years of the game, I'm not qualified to speak on such matters. What's for sure, however, is that it was the most thrilling one-on-one battle of my career.\"[27]In 1977, Nicklaus won his 63rd tour event, passing Ben Hogan to take second place on the career wins list, behind only Sam Snead. He also became the first player to amass over $3 million in official PGA Tour earnings. The year also saw Nicklaus win for the first time his own Memorial Tournament, where he described the victory as the most emotional moment of his entire career, and nearly decided to retire from competitive golf.During the 1977 Ryder Cup at Royal Lytham & St Annes, Nicklaus approached the PGA of Great Britain about the urgency to improve the competitive level of the contest. The issue had been discussed earlier the same day by both past PGA of America President Henry Poe and British PGA President Lord Derby. Nicklaus pitched his ideas, adding: \"It is vital to widen the selection procedures if the Ryder Cup is to continue to enjoy its past prestige.\" The changes in team selection procedure were approved by descendants of the Samuel Ryder family, along with The PGA of America. The major change was expanding selection procedures to include players from the European Tournament Players' Division, and \"that European Members be entitled to play on the team.\" This meant that professional players on the European Tournament Players' Division, the forerunner to the European Tour we have today, from continental Europe would be eligible to play in the Ryder Cup.Nicklaus won the 1978 Open Championship at St. Andrews to become the only player to have won each major championship three times.[2] This record has since been tied by Tiger Woods, by winning the 2008 U.S. Open. Nicklaus and Woods are the only two players to win three \"Career Grand Slams\". Nicklaus considered his performance in the 1978 Open as the finest four days of tee-to-green golf he had ever produced, and was most proud that the win came at St. Andrews, his favorite place to play golf. The victory was also his most emotional to date.Nicklaus won three other tournaments in 1978 on the PGA Tour, including the Jackie Gleason-Inverrary Classic, where he played the final 36 holes 13 under par; he scored five consecutive birdies over the closing holes in the final round.[28] He also won his third Tournament Players Championship in difficult weather conditions; he had won three of the first five stagings of that tournament, and remains the championship's only three-time winner. He was named Sportsman of the Year by Sports Illustrated. The year 1978 also marked Nicklaus' sixth and final Australian Open victory.Nicklaus suffered a lapse of form in 1979, not winning another tournament until June 1980. The year of 1979 was the first since turning professional in which he failed to win a tournament; he had only one runner-up finish, plus a tied-for-second with Ben Crenshaw behind 22-year-old Seve Ballesteros at The Open Championship. Previously, Nicklaus won at least one PGA Tour tournament per year (a record he shares with Arnold Palmer), and a minimum of two tournaments per year for 17 consecutive years, and this is another PGA Tour record.During the offseason, Nicklaus addressed two problems which had hurt his performance. His lifelong teacher Jack Grout noticed that he had become much too upright with his full swing, causing a steep, oblique approach into the ball, compared with a more direct hit; this was corrected by slightly flattening his backswing. Then Nicklaus' short game, never a career strength, was further developed with the help of Phil Rodgers, a friend for more than 20 years, and earlier PGA Tour rival, who had become a fine coach. Rodgers lived for a time at the Nicklaus home while this work was going on.[18]In 1980, Nicklaus recorded only four top-10 finishes in 14 events, but two of these were record-setting victories in majors (the U.S. Open and the PGA Championship); the other two were a tie for fourth in The Open Championship and a runner-up finish in the Doral-Eastern Open to Raymond Floyd via his chip-in birdie on the second hole of a sudden-death playoff. These victories and placements more than justified the work Nicklaus put in toward his game during the off-season.Nicklaus set a new scoring record for the 1980 U.S. Open with an aggregate of 272, eclipsing his earlier record of 275 from 1967 over the same golf course. That record, while since having been tied by three other players, stood until Rory McIlroy's 268 in winning the 2011 US Open. This was Nicklaus's second major win at Baltusrol Golf Club. Nicklaus opened with a record-tying 63 in round one and fought off his playing partner of all four rounds, 1978 Colgate World Match Play Championship winner, Isao Aoki. Entering the final round, Aoki had caught Nicklaus after three consecutive rounds of 68, but over the course of the last day, Nicklaus pulled away by two shots. Each player birdied the final two holes for a dramatic finish. Aoki's aggregate of 274 was the lowest score for a U.S. Open runner-up. Nicklaus' win was his fourth and final victory in the championship, tying him with Willie Anderson, Bobby Jones, and Ben Hogan. Nicklaus referred to this win as \"by far the most emotional and warmest reaction to any of my wins in my own country\".In the 1980 PGA Championship, Nicklaus set another record in winning the championship by seven shots over Andy Bean at the Oak Hill Country Club, largely due to exceptional putting. Nicklaus shot an even-par 70 in the first round followed by three successive rounds in the 60s over the difficult course, and was the only player to break par for the 72 holes. For the week, the field averaged 74.60 strokes while Nicklaus averaged 68.50. This was Nicklaus' fifth and final victory in the PGA Championship, which elevated him to record-holder for the most wins in the stroke-play era, and which tied him with Walter Hagen for the most wins overall, since Hagen's victories were all during the match-play era. Nicklaus' seven-shot winning margin remains the largest for the championship since it was converted from match play to stroke play in 1958. His victory also made Nicklaus the only player since Gene Sarazen in 1922 and Ben Hogan in 1948 to win the U.S. Open and PGA Championship the same year (subsequently equaled by Tiger Woods in 2000).Between 1981 to 1985, Nicklaus accumulated seven more top-10 placements in major championships, including three runner-up performances. He won only twice on the PGA Tour during this period, the Colonial National Invitation in 1982 and his own Memorial Tournament in 1984 for the second time, defeating Andy Bean in a sudden-death playoff to become the tournament's first repeat champion.In 1983, Nicklaus closed out the PGA Championship and World Series of Golf with brilliant final rounds of 65, and passed many players to move into contention, but finished runner-up in each to Player of the Year Hal Sutton and Nick Price, respectively, who dominated the tournaments from start to finish. Despite not winning a PGA Tour event in 1983, Nicklaus finished 10th on the PGA Tour money list, and passed a significant milestone by becoming the first player to eclipse the $4 million level in career earnings.In 1985, Nicklaus finished second in the Canadian Open to Curtis Strange, which marked his seventh and final second place finish in that tournament; this is a record for that event. These seven runner-up finishes came over the course of 21 events—or one second place finish for every three tournaments played—and does not include a third place finish in 1983, one shot out of the playoff between John Cook and Johnny Miller.During the five-year period between 1981 to 1985, the Ryder Cup matches provided Nicklaus with two bright spots. He completed his competition as a player in style by contributing a perfect 4–0–0 record (inclusive of a 5 & 3 anchor singles match win over Eamonn Darcy) in 1981, and captained the United States team in 1983 to a one-point win over Europe.In 1986, Nicklaus capped his major championship career by recording his sixth Masters victory under incredible circumstances, posting a six-under par 30 on the back nine at Augusta for a final round of seven-under-par 65. At the 17th hole, Nicklaus hit his second shot to within 18 feet (5.5 m) and rolled it in for birdie, raising his putter in celebration and completing an eagle-birdie-birdie run. Nicklaus made a solid par-4 at the 72nd hole, and waited for the succeeding players, several of whom (Tom Kite, Greg Norman) were still in contention, to fall short. Nicklaus played the final ten holes seven under par, with six birdies and an eagle. At age 46, Nicklaus became the oldest Masters winner in history, a record which still stands. On the feat, sports columnist Thomas Boswell remarked,\"Some things cannot possibly happen, because they are both too improbable and too perfect. The U.S. hockey team cannot beat the Russians in the 1980 Olympics. Jack Nicklaus cannot shoot 65 to win The Masters at age 46. Nothing else comes immediately to mind.\"[29]This victory was his 18th major title as a professional.Before the 1986 Masters Tournament, Tom McCollister, writing in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, said that Nicklaus was \"done, washed up, through,\" and this spurred him on. He said:\"I kept thinking all week, 'Through, washed up, huh?' I sizzled for a while. But then I said to myself, 'I'm not going to quit now, playing the way I'm playing. I've played too well, too long to let a shorter period of bad golf be my last.\"[30]This victory was to be his last in his long career on the PGA Tour, and was described at the time by noted golf historian and writer Herbert Warren Wind as \"nothing less than the most important accomplishment in golf since Bobby Jones' Grand Slam in 1930\".Author Ken Bowden would write after the win:\"There have been prettier swingers of the club than Jack Nicklaus. There may have been better ball-strikers than Jack Nicklaus. There have definitely been better short-game exponents than Jack Nicklaus. Other golfers have putted as well as Jack Nicklaus. There may have been golfers as dedicated and fiercely competitive as Jack Nicklaus. But no individual has been able to develop, combine and sustain all of the complex physical skills and the immense mental and emotional resources the game demands at its highest level as well as Jack Nicklaus has for as long as he has.\"At the age of 58, Nicklaus made another valiant run at the 1998 Masters, where he tied for sixth despite being hampered by an ever-increasing painful left hip.[31] Nicklaus' five-under par 283 is the lowest 72-hole score by a player over 50 in the Masters.Over the course of his 25-year span (1962–1986) of winning 18 major championships, Nicklaus finished second an astounding 18 times (excludes the second place finish at the 1960 U.S. Open as an amateur). He also placed third nine times and fourth seven times in this span and was one stroke out of a playoff on five of those occasions (1963 Open Championship, 1967 PGA Championship, 1975 Open Championship, 1977 PGA Championship, and 1979 Masters Tournament). His total span of 73 top-10 finishes over 39 years (1960–1998) is a record in total number as well as longevity among the four major championships and encompassed his tenure from an amateur through the majority of his Champions Tour career.Nicklaus became eligible to join the Senior PGA Tour, now known as the Champions Tour, when he turned 50 in January 1990,[32] at which point he declared, \"I'm never satisfied. Trouble is, I want to play like me—and I can't play like me anymore.\"[29] He then quickly won in his first start on the Tour, The Tradition, also a Senior Tour major championship. Nicklaus would go on to win another three Traditions—the final two in succession—while the most anyone else has won is two.Later in the year, Nicklaus won the Senior Players Championship by six shots over Lee Trevino for his second win of the year, and also his second major of the year by shooting a record 27-under par 261. The next year, in 1991, Nicklaus won three of the five events he started in, those being the U.S. Senior Open at Oakland Hills by firing a 65 in a playoff against Chi Chi Rodriguez and his fine round of 69, the PGA Seniors Championship and The Tradition for the second year straight. These, again, were all majors on the Champions Tour.Nicklaus has won all the Champions Tour majors with the exception of the Senior British Open. However, he never played in the Senior British Open until after he turned 60; this event was only elevated to a major in 2003. After a winless year in 1992, Nicklaus came back to win the U.S. Senior Open for the second time in 1993 by one shot over Tom Weiskopf. Also in that year he teamed up with Chi Chi Rodriguez and Raymond Floyd to win the Wendy's Three Tour Challenge for the Senior Tour team.[33]In 1994, Nicklaus won the Senior Tour's version of the Mercedes Championship for his only win of the year.[34] The Tradition was his again in 1995, in a year where he made the top 10 in all of the seven tournaments he entered in.[35] His 100th career win came the next year, when he won the Tradition for the fourth time, and second time in succession. He made a double eagle in the final round. Nicklaus closed the final 36 holes with back-to-back seven-under par rounds of 65 to shoot a 16-under par 272 and win by three shots over Hale Irwin. This was to be his last win on the Champions Tour, and the last official win of his career.[36]Nicklaus' final U.S. Open was held at Pebble Beach Golf Links in 2000, where he shot 73-82 to miss the cut.[37] Later in the year, he was paired with Tiger Woods and Vijay Singh in his final PGA Championship only a few days after the death of his mother, where he also missed the cut by one shot.[38][39] In both tournaments, Nicklaus provided last minute heroics by reaching the par-5 18th in two shots in the U.S. Open and nearly holing his wedge shot for eagle at the par-5 18th in the PGA Championship.Nicklaus played without much preparation in the 2005 Masters, a month after the tragic drowning death of his 17-month-old grandson Jake (child of his son, Steve) on March 1, 2005. In a written statement, Nicklaus said that it was impossible to put in words the devastation of his family. Nicklaus later spoke emotionally about the tragedy. He said: \"It's been an overwhelmingly difficult and trying time for my entire family. The loss of our precious 17-month-old grandson Jake was devastating.\"[40] Nicklaus and his son Steve played golf as therapy for their grief following Jake's death. After days of playing, it was Steve who suggested his father return to The Masters. He made that his last appearance in the tournament.[41]Later in 2005, Nicklaus finished his professional career at The Open Championship played at St Andrews on July 15, 2005.[42] On St Andrews, Nicklaus stated:\"I'm very sentimental and the place gets to me every time I go there. In May I walked around and welled up with hardly anyone watching me. St Andrews was always where I wanted to finish my major career\".[43]Nicklaus turned 65 in January that year, which was the last year he could enter The Open Championship as an exempt player. He played with Luke Donald and Tom Watson in his final round.[44] After hitting his tee shot off the 18th tee in the second round, Nicklaus received a ten-minute standing ovation from the crowd. On the eighteenth fairway, he gave his final farewell to professional golf while standing on the iconic Swilcan Bridge.[45] Soon afterwards, Nicklaus ended his career with a fitting birdie, holing a fifteen-foot birdie putt on the 18th green. Nicklaus missed the 36-hole cut with a score of +3 (147).[46]The last competitive tournament in which Nicklaus played in the United States was the Champions Tour's Bayer Advantage Classic in Overland Park, Kansas on June 13, 2005.[46]Nicklaus devotes much of his time to golf course design and operates one of the largest golf design practices in the world. In the mid-1960s, Pete Dye initially requested Nicklaus' opinion in the architecture process of The Golf Club in suburban Columbus, Ohio, and the input increased from that point forward. Nicklaus considered golf course design another facet of the game that kept him involved and offered a challenge. His first design Harbour Town Golf Links, co-credited with Dye, was opened for play in 1969.[47] A subsequent early, yet more prominent design was Muirfield Village Golf Club in Dublin, OH which opened in 1974 and has hosted the Memorial Tournament since its inception in 1976. This course has also hosted the 1987 Ryder Cup and the 1998 Solheim Cup matches. For the first few years, all of his projects were co-designs with either Pete Dye or Desmond Muirhead, who were two of the leading golf course architects of that era.His first solo design, Glen Abbey Golf Course in Oakville, Ontario, opened for play in 1976.[48] This course served as the host site for the Canadian Open for many years, the first being in 1977.[49] In 2000, the King & Bear opened in St. Augustine, Florida, as a joint collaboration between Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer. In 2006, the Concession Golf Club opened in Sarasota, Florida, as a joint collaboration between Nicklaus and Tony Jacklin, to commemorate their historic Ryder Cup singles match in 1969.Nicklaus is in partnership with his four sons and his son-in-law through their company, Nicklaus Design. The company had 299 courses open for play at the end of 2005, which was nearly 1% of all the courses in the world (In 2005 Golf Digest calculated that there were nearly 32,000 golf courses in the world, approximately half of them in the United States.[47][50]). While the majority of Nicklaus-designed courses reside in the United States, a significant presence also occupies Asia, Australia, Canada, Europe, and Mexico. For 2009, Nicklaus Design had 12 courses in Golf Digest's \"75 Best Golf Resorts in North America\". Past and present Senior Design Associates with Nicklaus Design include Chris Cochran,[51] Chet Williams[52] and Dave Heatwole.[53]Nicklaus has written several golf instructional books, an autobiography (My Story), a book on his golf course design methods and philosophy, and has produced several golf videos. The writer Ken Bowden often assisted him with this work. His book Golf My Way is one of the all-time classics of golf instruction, and has been reissued several times since the initial printing in 1974. Nicklaus has also written golf instructional columns for Golf Magazine and for Golf Digest magazine, with which he is currently associated. He also appeared as a television analyst and commentator with ABC Sports on golf broadcasts.[54] Several of the books have been reissued, sometimes under different titles, and My Story as a special high-quality limited edition for the 2000 Memorial Tournament.Between 1988 and 1998, Nicklaus also gave his name to promote the successful Jack Nicklaus Golf computer game series developed by Accolade. Several of the golf courses he designed were incorporated into the fourth incarnation of the game Jack Nicklaus 4 published in 1997. In addition, Jack Nicklaus 6: Golden Bear Challenge by Activision was published in 1999.Nicklaus continues to manage the Memorial Tournament he created in his home state of Ohio, which is played at Muirfield Village, a course which he co-designed with Desmond Muirhead and opened in 1974. The course was officially dedicated on Memorial Day, May 27, 1974, with an exhibition match between Nicklaus and Tom Weiskopf. Nicklaus scored a six-under par 66, which stood as the course record until 1979. The forerunner to this tournament, the Columbus Pro-Am, had its final year in 1975, and the inaugural Memorial Tournament was held the following year. The tournament is one of the more prestigious events on the PGA Tour.[18]Each year, the tournament selects one or more individuals as honorees who have made a significant impact to the game. The inaugural tournament in 1976 paid tribute to the late Bobby Jones, while the 25th edition in 2000 honored Nicklaus, himself. This concept was Nicklaus' idea as a contribution to perpetuating achievements of the game's greatest individuals. The honoree is selected by the Captain's Club, a group that acts independently of the tournament organization, but also advises on player invitations and the general conduct of the event. Members of the Captain's Club include Peter Alliss, Peggy Kirk Bell, George H.W. Bush, Sean Connery, Arnold Palmer, and Gary Player among others.The Memorial Tournament continues the PGA Tour's philanthropic focus through its relationships with Central Ohio charities. The most significant of which is its relationship with Nationwide Children's Hospital since 1976. Contributions generated through the support of over 2,600 volunteers are distributed each year to the Hospital's unrestricted giving fund. This fund assists in ensuring Central Ohio continues to have one of the best children's hospitals in the United States. The Memorial Tournament has raised more than $5.7 million to support the programs and services at Nationwide Children's Hospital in those 30-plus years. In 2005 the Memorial made a pledge that will elevate its level of giving to more than $11 million in the coming years. Unique and successful relationships also exist with Fore Hope, James Cancer Hospital, Wolfe Associates, The First Tee, Central Ohio Junior Golf Association, Shriners, Lions Club and many more.Nicklaus and wife Barbara serve as honorary chairman and active chairwoman of the Nicklaus Children's Health Care Foundation in North Palm Beach, Florida which provides valuable programs and services to more than 4,000 hospitalized children and their families, free of charge, through Child Life programs, the Pediatric Oncology Support Team, and the Safe Kids program. The Nicklauses established \"The Jake\", a pro-am golf tournament played annually at The Bear's Club in Jupiter, Florida in honor of their 17-month-old grandson who drowned in a hot tub in 2005. It has become the foundation's chief fundraiser. Players like Robert Allenby, Raymond Floyd, Tom Watson, Ian Baker-Finch, Ernie Els, Jay Haas, Johnny Miller, and Gary Player have participated. No one accepts a fee. Everything goes to the foundation, more than $3 million over the past three years.Nicklaus and retired General John Shalikashvili, who served as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff from 1993–97, are serving as honorary chairs for the American Lake Veterans Golf Course capital campaign in Tacoma, WA. The $4.5 million campaign in 2009 was established to complete the nation's only golf course designed for the rehabilitation of wounded and disabled veterans. The existing nine-hole course is operated, maintained, and managed by 160 volunteers. Funds are needed to add nine new holes and make other improvements to better accommodate demand from the growing influx of wounded veterans. A two-day event was held at Bighorn Golf Club at Palm Desert, CA featuring Nicklaus, who is donating his design services for the \"Nicklaus Nine\". In announcing his donation of services (valued at $500,000), Nicklaus said, \"I was moved to see the amazing efforts at American Lake Veterans Golf Course where our wounded warriors learn to play golf with the help of an incredible army of volunteers.\" Monies raised during the campaign will be used to construct the new holes, complete the construction of the Rehabilitation and Learning Center, make improvements to the original holes to enhance accessibility, upgrade the maintenance facilities and restrooms, and help underwrite operational costs.Nicklaus owns Nicklaus Golf Equipment, founded in 1992.[55] Nicklaus Golf Equipment manufactures equipment in three brands: Golden Bear, Jack Nicklaus Signature, and Nicklaus Premium. These brands are designed to target golfers at different stages of golfing ability.[56]He has also been known to reach out to younger golfers. One notable example came in 1984, when a teenage Canadian golfer who had previously met Nicklaus at an exhibition wrote him for career advice. The young golfer was right-handed but played left-handed; although he was showing considerable promise as a left-hander, he had been told that he might be an even better player if he switched to right-handed play. He wrote Nicklaus asking for advice; Nicklaus immediately wrote back telling him not to change if he was comfortable playing left-handed. The young Canadian, Mike Weir, decided to stay with left-handed play, and eventually became a Masters champion. He still keeps Nicklaus' letter framed in his home.[57]Nicklaus lends his name and likeness to a line of flavored lemonades from Arizona Beverage Company, the same company that sells the Arnold Palmer line of lemonade/iced tea blends.In 2010, Nicklaus partnered with Terlato Wines to produce a collection of three Napa Valley wines: Jack Nicklaus Private Reserve (a red blend), Cabernet Sauvignon and Private Reserve White (a white blend).[58] In 2009, Golden Bear Reserve, a Bordeaux-style red blend, was released to mark the 50th anniversary of Jack Nicklaus' first major championship victory, the 1962 U.S. Open.[59]Nicklaus was consistently among the longest and straightest hitters on the PGA Tour during his prime.[60] One early example was winning the official long drive contest at the 1963 PGA Championship with a belt of 341 yards, 17 inches (312 meters). This record lasted more than 20 years. He preferred the fade (left-to-right shape) for his ball flight, since this allowed the ball to stop quickly on hard and fast greens. Another factor in this decision was his distance capabilities, which were developed enough to allow him to play a fade and still reach long par fours and par fives in two shots.[7] Nicklaus considers his longest drive in competition to be during the final round of the 1964 Masters on the 15th hole, where he had less than 160 yards left to the 500 yard par five. He hit an eight-iron slightly over the green for his second shot.As his career matured, he also developed the ability to hit the right-to-left controlled draw when needed. Nicklaus debuted as a young pro who hit the ball very high, but he could also hit lower-trajectory shots when needed, after gaining pro experience.In 1968, IBM kept PGA Tour statistics for the first time, but did not continue this practice in the immediately subsequent years. Nicklaus led two categories for the 1968 season: he had an average driving distance of 275 yards, and hit 75 percent of greens in regulation; both marks were significantly ahead of rivals.[61]Even though official PGA Tour statistics did not begin until 1980, Nicklaus was consistently the leader in greens hit in regulation through that year, displaying great command of the long and middle irons. Indeed, Nicklaus remained in the top six of this category through 1985 – far past his best playing years. Nicklaus also finished 10th in driving distance and 13th in driving accuracy in 1980 at age 40, which equated to a \"Total Driving\" composite of 23 – a statistical level not attained since, by a comfortable margin. Nicklaus led this category through 1982. One key to Nicklaus' ball-striking ability and overall power was his exceptional swing tempo. Of this Tom Watson referred to it as Nicklaus' greatest strength in its ability to remain smooth. This proved an asset, especially under pressure, which allowed him to obtain great distance control with his irons.Nicklaus was also known for his course management skills. He would plan to hit each full shot to the optimal position, to best set up his next shot, usually aiming for level lies and clear approach lines, while favoring his preferred shot shapes. He would often hold back on power to achieve this, but had a power advantage over most rivals through the set, so that he could hit a 3-wood or 1-iron from the tee with increased accuracy to avoid trouble, with sufficient length to keep up with the drivers hit by most rivals. An exceptional example of this came in the final round of the 1966 Open Championship at Muirfield, on the 17th hole, a 530-yard par 5 hole. Nicklaus needed a birdie, but the hole was framed by tall fescue rough, and was playing downwind with very firm turf conditions. He used a 3-iron from the tee and hit the shot 290 yards, then hit a 5-iron 240 yards onto the green, two-putted for birdie, and parred the final hole to win the title.[18]Nicklaus was the first professional player to chart and document yardages on the course on a consistent, planned basis. For most of his career, Nicklaus was not known for his skill on touch shots with the wedges, so he would often play to avoid wedge shots which needed less-than-full swings. Gary Player states that Nicklaus had \"the greatest mind the game has ever known\".[62]While not known for being an outstanding putter, Nicklaus was often able to make the important putts when he needed them.[63] Nicklaus's putting was highly regarded by his rivals. He was also known as a conservative player at times, going for broke only when he needed to. This was especially apparent on the green, where he would often choose to be less aggressive and make sure of an easy two-putt. Nicklaus spoke about this in his autobiography. \"I was a fine two-putter, but sometimes too defensive—too concerned about three-putting—to go for putts that I probably should have gone for.\"[18]After his first year on the PGA Tour in 1962, Nicklaus received the PGA Tour Rookie of the Year award. As well as receiving the PGA Tour Player of the Year five times and topping the PGA Tour money list eight times, he has also attained the Bob Jones Award and the Payne Stewart Award, among others.Nicklaus was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame in the inaugural class of 1974 and the Canadian Golf Hall of Fame in 1995. His likeness was featured on a special commemorative issue five-pound note issued by the Royal Bank of Scotland, making him the first living person outside the Royal Family to appear on a British banknote.[64][65][66]There is a Jack Nicklaus Museum on the campus of The Ohio State University in his home town of Columbus, Ohio.[67] The museum was opened in 2002 and is a state-of-the-art, 24,000-square-foot (2,200 m2) facility offering a comprehensive view of Nicklaus' life and career in and out of golf as well as exhibits celebrating the history and legends of the game.Nicklaus had the rare privilege of \"dotting the 'i'\" of \"Script Ohio\", the signature formation of the Ohio State University Marching Band, at the Ohio State homecoming game on October 28, 2006 when the Buckeyes played Minnesota; this is considered the greatest honor that can be bestowed on a non-band member.[68] Nicklaus was the fifth non-band member to receive this award. Other recipients include Bob Hope and Woody Hayes. While at Ohio State University, Nicklaus became a member of the Fraternity of Phi Gamma Delta.[69]Along with Annika Sörenstam, Nicklaus was named a Global Ambassador for the International Golf Federation in 2008 and was instrumental in bringing golf to the Olympics for the 2016 and 2020 games. Golf was last an Olympic sport at the 1904 Games in St. Louis, Mo. when the United States and Canada were the only two competing countries. The International Olympic Committee approved the inclusion by a vote of 63–27, with two abstentions.Nicklaus joined Arnold Palmer as an honorary starter for the 2010 Masters. Nicklaus became the eighth honorary starter since the tradition began in 1963 when Nicklaus won his first green jacket. The Big Three were once again reunited in Augusta for the 2012 Masters Tournament as Gary Player joined Palmer and Nicklaus to kickoff the 76th renewal of the major tournament.Nicklaus, through his global reach in design and development, as well as the worldwide marketing and licensing of his golf and lifestyle brand, is atop Golf Inc. magazine's coveted list of the \"Most Powerful People in Golf\" for a record-extending sixth consecutive year. He is the only golf industry figure who has ever been named to the No. 1 spot for more than three years. Nicklaus topped the 2009 worldwide list of 35 individuals who were selected by a panel of editors for their ability to influence and impact the business of golf, be it the development of courses and communities, the operation of courses, the equipment used by golfers, or the rules and regulations of the game. Golf Inc. wrote that while the Golden Bear's reign at No. 1 is unprecedented, \"the fact is that he keeps adding to his legend, at the design table and in the business world. Despite a worldwide course development slowdown, Nicklaus's design firm has over 40 courses in development around the globe...And he remains perhaps golf's most respected spokesperson on a wide range of issues.\"On May 19, 2014, the United States House of Representatives voted to pass H.R. 2203, a bill that would award Nicklaus the Congressional Gold Medal \"in recognition of his service to the nation in promoting excellence and good sportsmanship.\"[70] The bill says that Nicklaus' \"magnetic personality and unfailing sense of kindness and thoughtfulness have endeared him to millions throughout the world.\"[71]During his career on the PGA Tour, Nicklaus holds the record for major championships with a total 18. He has the third most PGA Tour victories with 73, behind both Tiger Woods, with 79 and Sam Snead with a total of 82. Nicklaus also holds the outright record for the most wins at The Masters with six, and The Players Championship with three. He played on six Ryder Cup teams, captained the team twice and the Presidents Cup team four times, and topped the PGA Tour money list and scoring average eight times each. For 24 straight seasons, from 1960 to 1983 inclusive, he made at least one top ten finish in a major championship, and this is a record.1 Defeated Arnold Palmer in 18-hole playoff – Nicklaus 71 (E), Palmer 74 (+3).\n2 Defeated Tommy Jacobs & Gay Brewer in 18-hole playoff – Nicklaus 70 (−2), Jacobs 72 (E), Brewer 78 (+6).\n3 Defeated Doug Sanders in 18-hole playoff – Nicklaus 72 (E), Sanders 73 (+1).LA = low amateur\nDNP = did not play\nWD = withdrew due to injury\nCUT = missed the half way cut\n\"T\" indicates a tie for a place.\nGreen background for wins.

D. Mascott. The idea of Bond having a nephew was used again in 1991 in an American animated series for television, in which the title character defeats threats to ensure the safety of the free world. The series was mildly successful, spawning a six-volume novelization by John Peel (writing as John Vincent), a 12-issue comic book series by Marvel Comics published in 1992, and a video game for the NES and SNES.[2][3][4]While revolving around the nephew of James Bond, no surviving relatives are mentioned in Fleming’s novels, although he unknowingly conceives a child with former Japanese movie star Kissy Suzuki in You Only Live Twice.[5]The use of \"Jr.\" in the character's name is unusual in that this naming convention is generally reserved for sons, as opposed to nephews and other indirect offspring. Alternatively, it has been proposed that Fleming's James Bond had a brother, also named James Bond, who is the father of James Bond Jr.The animated series, produced by Murakami-Wolf-Swenson and United Artists Corporation, debuted on 30 September 1991, with a total of 65 half-hour episodes produced. James Bond Jr. was voiced by Corey Burton.[6]While attending prep school at Warfield Academy, James Bond Jr., with the help of his friends IQ (the grandson of Q), and Gordo Leiter (the son of Felix Leiter), fight against the evil terrorist organisation SCUM (Saboteurs and Criminals United in Mayhem), a SPECTRE-like organization. Expanding on his uncle's famous line, James Bond Jr's catchphrase was \"Bond, James Bond. Junior.\"[7]Like many animated series, it regularly surpasses the Bond movies in terms of fantastic gadgets, while the violence of the adult Bond series is nowhere in evidence. The show was fully sanctioned by (and produced in association with) Danjaq and United Artists, who held the rights to the James Bond property.Jaws, a recurring villain from the films The Spy Who Loved Me[8] and Moonraker,[9] made regular appearances, usually partnered with Nick Nack, a villain from The Man with the Golden Gun,[10] forming a bickering comical duo. Auric Goldfinger also appears, alongside his assistant, Oddjob, from the Goldfinger film.[11] It is revealed Goldfinger has a teenage daughter named Goldie Finger with equally expensive tastes. Several episode titles parodied the titles of Bond films such as Live and Let’s Dance and Rubies Aren't Forever.The main characters consist of James Bond Jr., his friends, several featured members of the Warfield Academy staff, and Trevor Noseworthy IV, are the series regulars, appearing in almost every episode of the series. Sometimes only two or three of Jr.'s friends will accompany him on an adventure, leaving the others behind at Warfield to create a B-plot. These plots normally revolve around Trevor's misguided attempts to get James into trouble.There were numerous villains in the series, most of whom worked for S.C.U.M. and made recurring appearances throughout the 65-episode run. Many characters looked nothing like their movie counterparts (e.g. Dr. No resembles a green-skinned, long-haired mutant). All recurring villains in the show are listed here.In most episodes James Bond Jr. encounters guest women, whom he's often forced to rescue. Following in the 007 tradition, many of their names are based on puns or double entendres. Some of the more notable include:James Bond Jr. The Game, was a Board Game released by Crown and Andrews,[13] the plot of which was to try to prevent the launch of nuclear missile.[14] Players collected computer disks, in order to deactivate the missile, while watching out for SCUM agents.[14]Three diecast toy vehicles was produced by ERTL in 1992: James' Sports Car, Warfield Van and the SCUM Helicopter.The James Bond Jr. toy line was manufactured by Hasbro.In 1992, Puffin Books published six novels based on the James Bond Jr. animated television show. The books were written by John Peel under the pseudonym John Vincent, and were based on episodes from the television run.In the UK, four of the TV episodes were adapted into a young children’s series by Buzz Books. Although the plots were basically the same, the books were much shorter and sometimes featured different characters from the TV show. The only villains never to appear in these books were Dr. No and Walker D. Plank.These books are not part of a series.James Bond Jr. had a limited 12 issue run with Marvel Comics spanning from January 1992 to December 1992.[88] The first five stories were lifted directly from the TV series, but the other seven were original stories. The writers were Cal Hamilton and Dan Abnett, and the artists were Mario Capaldi, Colin Fawcett, Adolfo Buylla, and Bambos Georgioli.James Bond Jr. was also a 1991 video game developed by Eurocom and published by THQ for the Nintendo Entertainment System[3] and the Super Nintendo Entertainment System.[4]","title":"","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/16/JamesBondJrTitleCard.jpg/200px-JamesBondJrTitleCard.jpg","developer":"","genre":""},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Pond_3:_Operation_Starfish","description":"James Pond 3: Operation Starfish (also spelled Operation Starfi5h, after the fictional secret service F.I.5.H) is a 1993 video game for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis.

Over the years, the show has expanded its brand beyond television and been licensed into products of various formats.In 1990, host Alex Trebek co-authored The Jeopardy! Book along with Peter Barsocchini, which included boards from some of their past tournament games as well as boards specializing in some of the show's various categories. (Trebek also voiced the audiobook, which featured the \"behind the scenes\" material on tape one, and audio versions of select games from the book on tape two.) Its sequel The Jeopardy! Challenge, also co-authored by Trebek, along with Griffin, included boards from their past tournament games, and was published in 1992.In 2000, the show's writers released 4 volumes of quiz books titled Jeopardy!: What is Quiz Book 1-4?, each featuring more than 300 pages worth of Jeopardy! boards from Seasons 14-17.In 2004, Barnes & Noble published This is Jeopardy!: Celebrating America's Favorite Quiz Show. Written by Ray Richmond, it featured selected Final Jeopardy! answers and questions from each of the show's first twenty seasons, plus trivia and other notable facts about the show.A number of unauthorized books have been published about Jeopardy!, written by people with ties to the show: Inside Jeopardy!: What Really Goes on at TV's Top Quiz Show (1993), written by former Jeopardy! writer and producer Harry Eisenberg, was reissued in 1995 as Jeopardy!: A Revealing Look Inside TV's Top Quiz Show with several allegations of scandal removed; Secrets of the Jeopardy! Champions (1992), written by Tournament of Champions winners Chuck Forrest and Mark Lowenthal, and How to Get on Jeopardy! and Win! (1998), written by Tournament of Champions winner Michael Dupée, serve as preparation aids for the Jeopardy! contestant hopeful; and Brainiac: Adventures in the Curious, Competitive, Compulsive World of Trivia Buffs (2006), by 74-game winner Ken Jennings and Prisoner of Trebekistan: A Decade in Jeopardy! (2006), written by comedian and former contestant Bob Harris, provide the insights of the extensive Jeopardy! experiences of two other notable champions who subsequently became authors of several books each.The earliest board games based on Jeopardy! were produced by Milton Bradley, which produced thirteen such games throughout the course of the original Fleming version's run (issued annually from 1964 through 1976); these games were numbered 1–12 and 14, skipping 13.The Trebek version has also seen various board game adaptations of its own. Pressman Toy Corporation first marketed several versions in the mid-to-late 1980s (including a version with electric signal devices and scoring consoles, released in 1987, and a \"25th Anniversary Edition\" to mark the anniversary of the original Art Fleming version debut (with special games featuring questions relating to the 1960s, in addition to new questions). Later versions were produced in the early 2000s, including a standard version, an all-Simpsons version, and most-recently an ESPN all-sports version (in both standard and \"travel folio\" versions) which, like the 1987 version before it, features an electronic buzz-in console. Tyco Toys and Parker Brothers have also manufactured their own board game adaptations of the Trebek version of Jeopardy![1]Jeopardy! has been adapted into a number of video games released on various consoles and handhelds spanning multiple hardware generations.[2] Most Jeopardy! games released prior to 1998 were published by GameTek, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection that year.An Atari 2600 adaptation of Jeopardy! was planned by The Great Game Co. in 1983, but that game ended up being cancelled during development.[3] Then, from 1987 to 1990, Rare Ltd. developed a series of three Jeopardy! games for the Nintendo Entertainment System. The first featured general knowledge questions,[4] the second was a \"Kids Edition\" featuring easier questions and child contestants,[5] and the third was an \"Anniversary Edition\" honoring the 25th anniversary of the original Art Fleming version's debut.[6] The Super Jeopardy! specials were also given a video game adaptation of their own for the NES, titled Talking Super Jeopardy! because of its periodic use of voice synthesis.[7]In 1992, GameTek released Jeopardy! video games for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System[8] and the Sega Genesis.[9] These two games were followed up by \"Sports Editions\"[10][11] and \"Deluxe Editions\" in 1994.[12][13] Then in 1994, Sony Imagesoft created a game based on the show for the Sega CD,[14] while Philips Interactive Media released a version for its CD-i console the following year.[15] GameTek's last Jeopardy! video game before its bankruptcy was released in 1998 for the Nintendo 64.[16]Hasbro Interactive produced two Jeopardy! video game adaptations of its own for Sony Computer Entertainment's PlayStation console in 1998 and 1999; both versions feature clues that are read by announcer Johnny Gilbert instead of host Alex Trebek;[17] while the second edition features behind-the-scenes interviews, an all-access backstage video, and a qualifying exam for contestants.[18] Afterwards, Hasbro Interactive's successor, Infogrames Entertainment (which would later go on to become Atari, SA), released a PlayStation 2 edition in October 2003.[19] Then in 2008, Sony Online Entertainment created a Jeopardy! game for the PlayStation 3 through the PlayStation Network.[20]On November 2, 2010, THQ released Jeopardy! video games for Nintendo's Wii console[21] and DS portable game system.[22] The company followed those up in 2012 by releasing games based on the show for the PlayStation 3, the Wii U,[23] and Microsoft's Xbox 360.A Game Boy version of Jeopardy! was released by GameTek in 1991,[24] and went on to spawn a \"Sports Edition.\"[25] Both versions were ported to the Game Boy's Sega rival, the Game Gear.[26][27] The gameplay in the Sports Edition is identical to the Super Nintendo and Genesis versions, though the portable versions lack the digitized voice and image of Alex Trebek and support only two players (where the console versions support three).[28] Tiger Electronics also released several Jeopardy! electronic games of its own, including a version for its Game.com system.[29] In 2004, Majesco Entertainment planned a port of Jeopardy! for Game Boy Color. However, the project was later cancelled.[30]In 2010, Sony Pictures Television, the show's production company, released an adaptation for the iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad.[31] The system was updated in 2012 with a number of online and local multiplayer modes.[32]Personal computers have seen many different adaptations of Jeopardy! The earliest was released in 1987 by Sharedata, which also released versions for the Apple II and the Commodore 64.[33] Sony Imagesoft later released its own PC version in 1994, along with the Sega CD version.[34] In 1998, shortly after GameTek's closure, Hasbro Interactive created a PC edition of Jeopardy!,[35] which was followed up by a version for Macintosh computers developed by MacSoft Games in 2000,[36] and later by an updated version published by Infogrames in 2003.[37] The show's latest PC adaptation was a \"Super Deluxe\" edition released by Encore, Inc. in 2008.[38]In April of 2011, GSN's interactive division teamed up with Sony Pictures Consumer Products to develop a Jeopardy! online game for Facebook,[39] but that game has since been taken down. As of March 2013, video game adaptations of Jeopardy! also exist on Twitter, Android, and the Roku Channel Store.[40]In 2002, in response to educators praising the longevity of the show's popularity and their students creating their own versions of the game to encourage student participation in class, educational toy company Educational Insights (which markets the GeoSafari system) released Classroom Jeopardy!, a self-contained, programmable game system based on Jeopardy! designed for use in schools.[41] With this system, the teacher plays the role of host, while students can play the game on a normal classroom television set or an interactive whiteboard. Teachers are permitted to either use standardized games created for the grade levels of their classes, or write customized games of their own covering material that they are teaching at the moment.[42] Originally, the game used a cartridge-based system for the categories and wireless remotes for the players and the host, with the unit itself acting as the scoreboard. There was also a small laptop-style keyboard that connected to the game unit and allowed for programming the cartridges via a small LCD screen on the unit. The uprated version of the system replaced the LCD screen and keyboard with a USB-connected device known as the \"Classroom Jeopardy! Link,\" which allowed programming of the cartridges (and storage of unused games) via a PC or Macintosh (which included \"Classroom Jeopardy! Editor\" software).The success of Classroom Jeopardy! led to the production of a home version, called Host Your Own Jeopardy!, which was released in 2004. Except for the names and included question content, this version was identical to the Classroom version. The Classroom edition featured one cartridge with 5 pre-programmed school-subject-based games; while the Host Your Own edition included four cartridges featuring 20 games used on the show, ranging from Kids Week level to Tournament Of Champions level. Educational Insights also produced additional scoreboards and controller units that could be connected to the main system and allow for more players per game (a maximum of nine additional scoreboards could be added, making for a maximum of 30 players/teams per game, although only the six highest-scoring players/teams could participate in Final Jeopardy!).In 2011, Educational Insights released an updated version of the Classroom Jeopardy! system. The updated system featured a restyling of the console and remotes, dry-erase Final Jeopardy! boards, and a host remote with LCD \"correct response\" display. Additional functions included the ability to enter players' names into the console, and more varied wagers for Daily Doubles and Final Jeopardy! Additionally, this system used USB Flash Drives in place of the cartridges to program the console (the system included a 512K Flash Drive, but other larger Flash Drives could also be used). This also makes the updated system capable of using audiovisual clues (such as audio and video clips, music cues, and still images), properly-formatted math equation clues, and foreign \"romance language\" characters. The new system is not backward-compatible with the older cartridges and accessories, but games written with the older system's software can be easily converted via the new system's \"Clue Studio\" program. The entirety of the new system also fits into an included storage suitcase, allowing for easier transport of the unit. Both editions of the game are still available through the company's website, although the older system's price has dropped substantially.[43][44]A DVD titled Jeopardy!: An Inside Look at America's Favorite Quiz Show was released on November 8, 2005 by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment. It features five of the most memorable episodes of the Trebek version: the very first Trebek episode in 1984, Episode #4657 (Ken Jennings' losing episode), and Episodes #4781, #4782, and #4783 (the three finals games of the Ultimate Tournament of Champions, the last of which can be viewed through multiple camera angles),[45] and there are also three featurettes: 21 Years of Answers and Questions, which discusses the show's history; and Jeopardy!: Behind the Answers and What Does It Take to Get a Clue?, both of which discuss the show's question selection process.[46] The DVD also features some funny moments from the show, including Trebek presenting the beginning of the first show of the Ultimate Tournament of Champions Finals without trousers, and Johnny Gilbert mistaking Trebek for contestant coordinator Glenn Kagan, who rehearses as him; both of these are Easter eggs displayed as the show's trademark \"Daily Doubles\". The DVD's menu is displayed as the show's trademark game board, with the menu options as \"categories\"; picking one of these causes the board to load up, complete with sound effect, similar to the show.[47]In 2007, MGA Entertainment released the Jeopardy! DVD Home Game System, which allows groups of players to play the game of Jeopardy! from home with a similar experience to appearing on the actual show.[48]For the show's 15th anniversary season in 1998-1999, a collectible watch was released. It plays the show's theme song, \"Think!\", with a push of a button, and includes 25 game cards with the answer-question format. Despite poor sales, several watches are currently being auctioned and sold on eBay as of today.Every year, Day-to-Day Calendars' subsidiary Andrews McMeel Publishing releases a daily desktop Jeopardy! calendar, featuring 52 games for every week of the year, all of which have 1 clue per day (with the correct response on the back of each day's sheet). Entries for Monday through Wednesday are Jeopardy! Round Clues, those for Thursday through Saturday are Double Jeopardy! Round clues, and Sunday's entry is a Final Jeopardy! clue which allows the owner to \"wager\" all or part of their \"total weekly winnings.\"The brand has also been licensed into various slot machine games for casinos and the Internet.","title":"","developer":"","genre":""},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeopardy!","description":"Jeopardy! is an American television game show created by Merv Griffin. The show features a quiz competition in which contestants are presented with general knowledge clues in the form of answers, and must phrase their responses in the form of questions. The original daytime version debuted on NBC on March 30, 1964, and aired until January 3, 1975. A weekly nighttime syndicated edition aired from September 1974 to September 1975, and a revival, The All-New Jeopardy!, ran on NBC from October 1978 to March 1979. A daily syndicated version premiered on September 10, 1984, and is still airing, making it by far the program's most successful incarnation.Both NBC versions and the weekly syndicated version were hosted by Art Fleming. Don Pardo served as announcer until 1975, and John Harlan announced for the 1978–79 show. Since its inception, the daily syndicated version has featured Alex Trebek as host and Johnny Gilbert as announcer.With over 6,000 episodes aired,[4] the daily syndicated version of Jeopardy! has won a record 31 Daytime Emmy Awards and a Peabody Award. The program has gained a worldwide following with regional adaptations in many foreign countries. The 31st season of the daily syndicated Jeopardy! premiered on September 15, 2014.Three contestants take their place behind three lecterns, with the returning champion occupying the leftmost lectern (from the viewer's perspective). The contestants compete in a quiz game comprising three rounds: Jeopardy!, Double Jeopardy!, and Final Jeopardy![5] The material for the questions covers a wide variety of topics (including history and current events, the sciences, the arts, popular culture, literature, and languages);[6] category titles often feature puns, wordplay, or shared themes.The Jeopardy! and Double Jeopardy! rounds each feature six categories, each of which contains five clues, which are ostensibly valued by difficulty.[5] Clue values have risen over time: on the original Jeopardy! series, clue values in the first round ranged from $10 to $50;[7] on The All-New Jeopardy!, values ranged from $25 to $125; and on the daily syndicated version, values originally ranged from $100 to $500,[5] but were doubled beginning November 26, 2001.[8] On the Super Jeopardy! specials, clues were valued in points rather than in dollars, and ranged in the first round from 200 to 1,000 points.The Jeopardy! round begins when the returning champion selects a clue, which may be from any position on the game board. The clue is revealed and read aloud by the host, after which any contestant may ring in using a hand-held signaling device. The first contestant to ring in successfully is prompted to provide a response to the clue, phrased in the form of a question.[5] For example, if a contestant were to select \"Presidents for $200\", the resulting clue could be \"This 'Father of Our Country' didn't really chop down a cherry tree\", to which the correct response would be \"Who is George Washington?\" If the contestant responds correctly, the clue's dollar value is added to the contestant's score, and they may select a new clue from the board. An incorrect response, or a failure to respond within five seconds, deducts the clue's value from the contestant's score and allows the other contestants the opportunity to ring in and respond.[5] If no contestant responds correctly, the host reveals the correct response, and the contestant who selected the clue may choose the next clue.[9]In the show's current version, contestants may not ring in before the host finishes reading the clue. Originally, contestants were allowed to ring in at any time after the clue was revealed, but that rule was changed in 1985, at the start of the daily syndicated version's second season, both to allow home viewers to play along more easily and to decrease the likelihood of faster contestants dominating the game. To accommodate the rule change, lights were added to the game board (unseen by home viewers) to signify when it is permissible for contestants to signal;[10] attempting to signal before the light goes on locks the contestant out for one-fourth of a second.[11] In pre-1985 episodes, a buzzer would sound when a contestant signaled; according to Trebek, the buzzer was eliminated because it was \"distracting to the viewers\" and sometimes presented a problem when contestants rang in while Trebek was still reading the clue.[10]The second round, Double Jeopardy!, features six new categories of clues. Clue values are doubled from the Jeopardy! round[5] (except in Super Jeopardy!, where Double Jeopardy! values ranged from 500 to 2,500 points). The contestant with the least money at the end of the Jeopardy! round makes the first selection in Double Jeopardy!;[9] if there is a tie, the tied contestant standing at the leftmost lectern selects first.One clue hidden on the Jeopardy! board, and two on the Double Jeopardy! board, are \"Daily Doubles\",[5] taking their name and inspiration from a horse racing term.[12] Only the contestant who selected the Daily Double clue may respond to that clue. Before the clue is revealed, the contestant must decide how much of their current score to wager, from a minimum of $5 to a maximum of their entire score (known as a \"true Daily Double\") or the highest clue value available in the round, whichever is greater.[9] Whether or not the contestant answers the Daily Double correctly, the contestant maintains control of the board and the right to select the subsequent clue.[9]During the Jeopardy! round, except in response to the Daily Double clue, contestants are not penalized for forgetting to phrase their response in the form of a question (e.g. \"George Washington\" instead of \"Who is George Washington?\"), although the host will remind contestants to watch their phrasing in future responses. In the Double Jeopardy! round and in the Daily Double in the Jeopardy! round, the phrasing rule is followed more strictly, but contestants are still permitted to correct themselves before their time runs out. If it is determined that a previous response was wrongly ruled to be correct or incorrect, the scores are adjusted at the first available opportunity. If, after a game is over, a ruling change is made that would have significantly altered the outcome of the game, the affected contestant(s) are invited back to compete on a future show.[13]Contestants who finish Double Jeopardy! with $0 or a negative score are automatically eliminated from the game at that point and awarded the third place prize. On at least one episode hosted by Art Fleming, all three contestants finished Double Jeopardy! with $0 or less, and as a result, no Final Jeopardy! round was played.[14] During Celebrity Jeopardy! games, contestants with a $0 or negative score are given $1,000 for the Final Jeopardy! round.The Final Jeopardy! round features a single clue. At the end of the Double Jeopardy! round, the host announces the Final Jeopardy! category, and a commercial break follows. During the break, barriers are placed between the contestant lecterns, and each contestant makes a final wager between $0 and their current score. Contestants enter their wagers using a light pen to write on an electronic display on their lectern.[15] After the break, the Final Jeopardy! clue is revealed and read by the host. The contestants have thirty seconds to write their responses on the electronic display, while the show's iconic \"Think!\" music plays in the background.Contestants' responses are revealed in order of their pre-Final Jeopardy! scores, beginning with the lowest score. Contestants who provide the correct response receive the values of their wagers, while contestants who fail to provide the correct response, or to phrase their response in the form of a question, have that amount subtracted from their scores.[9] The contestant with the highest score at the end of the round is that day's winner. If there is a tie for first place, the tying contestants are co-champions.The top scorer(s) in each game retain the value of their winnings in cash, and return to play in the next match.[5] Non-winners receive consolation prizes. Since May 16, 2002, consolation prizes have been $2,000 for the second-place contestant(s) and $1,000 for the third-place contestant.[16] Since the show does not generally provide airfare or lodging for contestants, cash consolation prizes alleviate contestants' financial burden. The show does provide airfare for returning champions who must make multiple flights to Los Angeles.[17]Prior to the Trebek version of the show, all three contestants received their winnings in cash (contestants who finished with $0 or a negative score received consolation prizes). This was changed in order to make the game more competitive, and avoid the problem of contestants who would stop participating in the game, or avoid wagering in Final Jeopardy!, rather than risk losing the money they had already accumulated.[18] From 1984 to 2002, non-winning contestants on the Trebek version received vacation packages and merchandise, which were donated by manufacturers as promotional consideration.[19]The winner of each episode returns to compete against two new contestants on the next episode. Originally, a contestant who won five consecutive days retired undefeated and was guaranteed a spot in the Tournament of Champions; the five-day limit was eliminated at the beginning of Season 20 on September 8, 2003.[20]If multiple contestants tie for first place, they are declared co-champions; each retains his or her winnings and returns on the following episode. Contestants who have finished two games as co-champions have included Dane Garrett in Season 2, Sara Cox in Season 7, Dan Girard in Season 14,[21] and Kristin Morgan in Season 29.[22] A three-way tie for first place has only occurred once on the Trebek version, on March 16, 2007, when Scott Weiss, Jamey Kirby, and Anders Martinson all ended the game with $16,000.[23]If no contestant finishes Final Jeopardy! with a positive total, there is no winner. This has happened in several episodes, including the episodes aired on September 11, 1984;[24] March 2, 1998;[25] and June 12, 1998.[26] In this situation, three new contestants appear on the following show, and participate in a backstage draw to determine their lectern positions.Special considerations have been given for contestants who were unable to return as champion due to circumstances beyond their control. This occurred for the first time in Season 25, when Priscilla Ball, who won on January 16, 2009, was unable to attend the taping of the next episode because of illness; as a result, three new contestants appeared on the next episode.[27] Ball returned as a co-champion to play on the episode airing April 9, 2009.[28]Tournaments generally run for ten consecutive episodes and feature fifteen contestants. The first five episodes, the quarter-finals, feature three new contestants each day. The five quarter-finals winners, and the four non-winners with the highest scores, advance to the semi-finals, which run for three days. The three semi-finals winners advance to play in two final games; the scores from both finals are combined to determine the tournament's winner. This format has been used since the first Tournament of Champions in 1985 and was devised by Trebek himself.[29]If two or more contestants have the same positive score at the end of a semi-final game, or at the end of the finals after combining the totals from the first and second games, a one-clue tiebreaker is used. The tied contestants are given a category, and then the clue. The first contestant to ring in and respond correctly becomes that game's winner. Contestants are not eliminated for providing an incorrect response, and cannot win by default.If a quarter-final or semi-final tournament game ends in which no contestant finishes with a positive score, all three contestants are eliminated and a wild card contestant advances instead.[30] This occurred in the first round of the 1991 Seniors Tournament and the semifinals of the 2013 Teen Tournament.[30]In a 1964 Associated Press profile released shortly before the original Jeopardy! series premiered, Merv Griffin offered the following account of how he created the quiz show:My wife Julann just came up with the idea one day when we were in a plane bringing us back to New York from Duluth. I was mulling over game show ideas, when she noted that there had not been a successful \"question and answer\" game on the air since the quiz show scandals. Why not do a switch, and give the answers to the contestant and let them come up with the question? She fired a couple of answers to me: \"5,280\" – and the question of course was \"How many feet in a mile?\". Another was \"79 Wistful Vista\"; that was Fibber and Mollie McGee's address. I loved the idea, went straight to NBC with the idea, and they bought it without even looking at a pilot show.[31]Griffin's first conception of the game used a board comprising ten categories with ten clues each, but after finding that this board could not easily be shown on camera, he reduced it to two rounds of thirty clues each, with five clues in each of six categories.[32] He originally intended the show to require grammatically correct phrasing (e.g., only accepting \"Who is...\" for a person), but after finding that grammatical correction slowed the game down, he decided that the show should instead accept any correct response that was in question form.[33] Griffin discarded his initial title for the show, What's the Question?, when skeptical network executive Ed Vane rejected his original concept of the game, claiming, \"It doesn't have enough jeopardies\".[32][34]Jeopardy! was not the first game show to give contestants the answers and require the questions. That format had previously been used by the Gil Fates-hosted program CBS Television Quiz, which aired from July 1941 until May 1942.[35]The daily syndicated version of Jeopardy! is produced by Sony Pictures Television (previously known as Columbia TriStar Television, the successor company to original producer Merv Griffin Enterprises).[36] The copyright holder is Jeopardy Productions, which, like SPT, operates as a subsidiary of Sony Pictures Entertainment.[37] The rights to distribute the program on television in the United States are owned by CBS Television Distribution, which absorbed original distributor King World Productions in 2007.[36]The original Jeopardy! series was taped in Studio 6A at NBC Studios at 30 Rockefeller Plaza in New York City,[38] and The All-New Jeopardy! was taped in Studio 3 at NBC's Burbank Studios at 3000 West Alameda Avenue in Burbank, California.[3] The Trebek version was initially taped at Metromedia Stage 7, KTTV-TV, on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood,[3] but moved its production facilities to Hollywood Center Studios' Stage 9 in 1985. After the final shows of Season 10 were recorded on February 15, 1994, the Jeopardy! production facilities were moved to Sony Pictures Studios' Stage 10 on Washington Boulevard in Culver City, California,[3] where the show has been filmed ever since.Various technological and aesthetic changes have been made to the Jeopardy! set over the years. The original game board was exposed from behind a curtain and featured clues printed on cardboard pull cards which were revealed as contestants selected them.[7] The All-New Jeopardy!'s game board was exposed from behind double-slide panels and featured flipping panels with the dollar amount on one side and the clue on the other. When the Trebek version premiered in 1984, the game board used individual television monitors for each clue within categories. The original monitors were replaced with larger and sleeker ones in 1991.[39] In 2006, these monitors were discarded in favor of a nearly seamless projection video wall,[40] which was replaced in 2009 with 36 high-definition flat-panel monitors manufactured by Sony Electronics.[41]From 1985–97, the sets were designed to have a background color of blue for the Jeopardy! round and red for the Double Jeopardy! and Final Jeopardy! rounds. At the beginning of Season 8 in 1991, a brand new set was introduced that resembled a grid.[39] On the episode aired November 11, 1996, two months after the start of Season 13, Jeopardy! introduced the first of several sets designed by Naomi Slodki, who intended the set to resemble \"the foyer of a very contemporary library, with wood and sandblasted glass and blue granite\".[42]Shortly after the start of Season 19 in 2002, the show switched to yet another new set,[43] which was given slight modifications when Jeopardy! and sister show Wheel of Fortune transitioned to high-definition broadcasting in 2006.[40] During this time, the show began to feature virtual tours of the set on its official web site.[44] The various HD improvements for Jeopardy! and Wheel represented a combined investment of approximately $4 million, 5,000 hours of labor, and 6 miles (9.7 km) of cable.[40] Both shows had been shot using HD cameras for several years before beginning to broadcast in HD. On standard-definition television broadcasts, the shows continue to be displayed with an aspect ratio of 4:3.In 2009, Jeopardy! updated its set once again. The new set debuted with special episodes taped at the 42nd annual International CES technology trade show, hosted at the Las Vegas Convention Center in Winchester (Las Vegas Valley), Nevada, and became the primary set for Jeopardy! when the show began taping its 26th season, which premiered on September 14, 2009.[41] It was significantly remodeled when Season 30 premiered in September 2013.[45]Since the debut of Jeopardy! in 1964, several different songs and arrangements have served as the theme music for the show, most of which were composed by Griffin. The main theme for the original Jeopardy! series was \"Take Ten\",[46] composed by Griffin's wife Julann.[47] The All-New Jeopardy! opened with \"January, February, March\" and closed with \"Frisco Disco\", both of which were composed by Griffin himself.[48]The best-known theme song on Jeopardy! is \"Think!\", originally composed by Griffin under the title \"A Time for Tony\", as a lullaby for his son.[49] \"Think!\" has always been used for the 30-second period in Final Jeopardy! when the contestants write down their responses, and since the syndicated version debuted in 1984, a rendition of that tune has been used as the main theme song.[50] \"Think!\" has become so popular that it has been used in many different contexts, from sporting events to weddings.[51] Griffin estimated that the use of \"Think!\" had earned him royalties of over $70 million throughout his lifetime.[52] \"Think!\" led Griffin to win the Broadcast Music, Inc. (BMI) President's Award in 2003,[53] and during GSN's 2009 Game Show Awards special, it was named \"Best Game Show Theme Song\".[54] The main theme and Final Jeopardy! recordings of \"Think!\" were later rearranged by Steve Kaplan, who served as the show's music director until his 2003 death.[55] When the show began its 25th season in 2008, the Jeopardy! music package was given a complete overhaul by Chris Bell Music and Sound Design.[56]Prospective contestants of the original Jeopardy! series called the show's office in New York to arrange an appointment and to preliminarily determine eligibility. They were briefed and auditioned together in groups of ten to thirty individuals, participating in both a written test and mock games. Successful auditioners were invited to appear on the program within approximately six weeks.[57]Auditioning for the current version of the show begins with a written exam, comprising fifty questions in total. This exam is administered online periodically, as well as being offered at regional contestant search events. Since Season 15 (1998-1999), the show has used a Winnebago recreational vehicle called the \"Jeopardy! Brain Bus\" to conduct regional events throughout the United States and Canada.[58] Participants who correctly answer at least 35 out of 50 questions advance in the audition process and are invited to compete in mock games. Those who are approved are notified at a later time and invited to appear on the show.The first three versions of the show were hosted by Art Fleming. Don Pardo served as announcer for the original NBC version and weekly syndicated version,[7] but when NBC's revival The All-New Jeopardy! launched in 1978, Pardo's announcing duties were taken over by John Harlan.[59]Alex Trebek has served as host of the daily syndicated version since it premiered in 1984,[60] except when he switched places with Wheel of Fortune host Pat Sajak as an April Fool's joke on the episode aired April 1, 1997.[61] In March 2013, following rumors that Trebek would be stepping down in 2016, various personalities reportedly considered to replace him included Matt Lauer,[62] Anderson Cooper, Brian Williams, and Dan Patrick.[63] In June 2013 Trebek denied that he had plans to retire.[64] In the daily syndicated version's first pilot, from 1983, Jay Stewart served as the show's announcer,[65] but Johnny Gilbert took over the role when that version was picked up as a series and has held it since then.[60]The Jeopardy! Clue Crew, introduced on September 24, 2001, is a team of roving correspondents who appear in videos, recorded around the world, to narrate some clues.[66] Explaining why the Clue Crew was added to the show, executive producer Harry Friedman said, \"TV is a visual medium, and the more visual we can make our clues, the more we think it will enhance the experience for the viewer.\"[67]Following the initial announcement of auditions for the team, over 5,000 people applied for Clue Crew posts.[67] The original Clue Crew members were Cheryl Farrell, Jimmy McGuire, Sofia Lidskog, and Sarah Whitcomb.[66] Lidskog departed the Clue Crew in 2004 to become an anchor on the high school news program Channel One News, and a search was held to replace her in early 2005.[68] The winners were Jon Cannon and Kelly Miyahara, who formally joined the crew starting in Season 22, which premiered on September 12, 2005.[69] Farrell continued to appear on the program through 2007. Cannon left in 2008.[65]The Clue Crew has traveled to 280 cities worldwide, spanning all 50 of the United States and 44 other countries. In addition to appearing in Jeopardy! clue videos, the team's members also travel to meet fans of the show and future contestants. Occasionally, they visit schools to showcase the educational game Classroom Jeopardy![70]Robert Rubin served as the producer of the original Jeopardy! series for most of its run, and later became its executive producer.[71] Following Rubin's promotion, the line producer was Lynette Williams.[71]Griffin was the daily syndicated version's executive producer until his retirement in 2000.[72] Trebek served as producer as well as host until 1987, when he began hosting NBC's Classic Concentration for the next four years.[72] At that time, he handed producer duties to George Vosburgh, who had formerly produced The All-New Jeopardy!. In the 1997–98 season, Vosburgh was succeeded as producer by Harry Friedman, Lisa Finneran, and Rocky Schmidt. Beginning in 1999, Friedman became executive producer,[73] and Gary Johnson became the show's new third producer. In the 2006–07 season, Deb Dittman and Brett Schneider became the producers, and Finneran, Schmidt, and Johnson were promoted to supervising producers.[71]The original Jeopardy! series was directed at different times by Bob Hultgren, Eleanor Tarshis, and Jeff Goldstein.[71] Dick Schneider, who directed episodes of The All-New Jeopardy!, returned as director for the Trebek version's first eight seasons. Since 1992, the show has been directed by Kevin McCarthy, who had previously served as associate director under Schneider.[72]The current version of Jeopardy! employs nine writers and five researchers to create and assemble the categories and clues.[74] Billy Wisse and Michele Loud, both longtime staff members, are the editorial producer and editorial supervisor, respectively.[75] Previous writing and editorial supervisors have included Jules Minton, Terrence McDonnell, and Gary Johnson.[71]The show's production designer is Naomi Slodki.[75] Previous art directors have included Henry Lickel, Dennis Roof,[76] Bob Rang,[71] and Ed Flesh (who also designed sets for other game shows such as The $25,000 Pyramid, Name That Tune, and Wheel of Fortune).[77]The original Jeopardy! series premiered on NBC on March 30, 1964,[3] and by the end of the 1960s was the second-highest-rated daytime game show, behind only The Hollywood Squares.[78] The show was successful until 1974, when Lin Bolen, then NBC's Vice President of Daytime Programming, moved the show out of the noontime slot where it had been located for most of its run, as part of her effort to boost ratings among the 18–34 female demographic.[79] After 2,753 episodes, the original Jeopardy! series ended on January 3, 1975; to compensate Griffin for its cancellation, NBC purchased Wheel of Fortune, another show that he had created, and premiered it the following Monday.[1] A syndicated edition of Jeopardy!, distributed by Metromedia and featuring many contestants who were previously champions on the original series, aired in the primetime during the 1974–75 season.[80] The NBC daytime series was later revived as The All-New Jeopardy!, which premiered on October 2, 1978[81] and aired 108 episodes, ending on March 2, 1979;[82] this revival featured significant rule changes, such as progressive elimination of contestants over the course of the main game, and a bonus round instead of Final Jeopardy![5]The daily syndicated version debuted on September 10, 1984,[83] and was launched in response to the success of the syndicated version of Wheel[84] and the installation of electronic trivia games in pubs and bars.[85] This version of the program has met with greater success than the previous incarnations; it has outlived 300 other game shows and become the second most popular game show in syndication (behind Wheel), averaging 25 million viewers per week. The show's most recent renewal, in October 2012, extends it through the 2015–16 season.[86]Jeopardy! has spawned versions in many foreign countries throughout the world, including Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, Sweden, Russia, Denmark, Israel, and Australia.[87] International distribution of the American syndicated version of Jeopardy! is handled by CBS Studios International, which is a unit of CBS Corporation.[88]Three spin-off versions of Jeopardy! have been created. Rock & Roll Jeopardy! debuted on VH1 in 1998[89] and ran until 2001; the show centered around post-1950s popular music trivia and was hosted by Jeff Probst.[5] Jep!, which aired on GSN during the 1998–99 season, was a special children's version hosted by Bob Bergen and featured various rule changes from the Trebek version.[90] Sports Jeopardy!, an exclusively online version hosted by Dan Patrick, premiered in 2014 on the Crackle digital service.[91]Only a small number of episodes of the first three Jeopardy! versions survive. From the original NBC daytime version, archived episodes mostly consist of black-and-white kinescopes of the original color videotapes.[92] Various episodes from 1967, 1971, 1973, and 1974 are listed among the holdings of the UCLA Film and Television Archive.[93] The 1964 \"test episode\", Episode No. 2,000 (from February 21, 1972), and a June 1975 episode of the weekly syndicated edition exist at the Paley Center for Media.[94] Incomplete paper records of the NBC-era games exist on microfilm at the Library of Congress. GSN holds The All-New Jeopardy!'s premiere and finale in broadcast quality, and aired the latter on December 31, 1999, as part of its \"Y2Play\" marathon.[82] The UCLA Archive holds a copy of a pilot taped for CBS in 1977,[93] and the premiere exists among the Paley Center's holdings.[94]All Trebek-hosted episodes of Jeopardy! are completely intact, including both pilot episodes. GSN, which, like Jeopardy!, is an affiliate of Sony Pictures Television, has rerun ten seasons since the channel's launch in 1994. Copies of 43 Trebek-hosted syndicated Jeopardy! episodes aired between 1989 and 2004 have been collected by the UCLA Archive,[93] and the premiere and various other episodes are included in the Paley Center's collection.[94]Jeopardy! has won a record 31 Daytime Emmy Awards since 1984.[74] The show holds the record for the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Game/Audience Participation Show, with thirteen awards won in that category.[74] Another five awards have been won by Trebek for Outstanding Game Show Host.[74] Twelve other awards were won by the show's directors and writers in the respective categories of Outstanding Direction for a Game/Audience Participation Show and Outstanding Special Class Writing before these categories were removed in 2006. On June 17, 2011, Trebek shared the Lifetime Achievement Award with Sajak at the 38th Annual Daytime Emmy Awards ceremony.[95] The following year, the show was honored with a Peabody Award for its role in encouraging, celebrating, and rewarding knowledge.[96]In its April 17–23, 1993 issue, TV Guide named Jeopardy! the best game show of the 1970s as part of a celebration of its 40th anniversary.[97] In January 2001, the magazine ranked the show number 2 on its \"50 Greatest Game Shows\" list—second only to The Price Is Right.[98] It would later rank Jeopardy! number 1 in its 2013 list of the 60 Greatest Game Shows (with Price slipping to number 5).[99] In the summer of 2006, the show was ranked number 2 on GSN's list of the 50 Greatest Game Shows of All Time, second only to Match Game.[100]A hall of fame honoring Jeopardy! was added to the Sony Pictures Studios tour on September 20, 2011. It features the show's Emmy Awards as well as retired set pieces, classic merchandise, video clips, photographs, and other memorabilia related to Jeopardy! history.[101]Starting in 1985, the show has held an annual Tournament of Champions featuring the top fifteen champions who have appeared on the show since the last tournament. The top prize awarded to the winner was originally valued at $100,000,[87] and increased to $250,000 in 2003.[102] Other regular tournaments include the Teen Tournament, with a $75,000 top prize;[88] the College Championship, in which undergraduate students from American colleges and universities compete for a $100,000 top prize; and the Teachers Tournament, where educators compete for a $100,000 top prize.[4] Each tournament runs for ten consecutive episodes in a format devised by Trebek himself, consisting of five quarter-final games, three semifinals, and a final consisting of two games with the scores totaled.[29] Winners of the College Championship and Teachers Tournament are invited to participate in the Tournament of Champions.Non-tournament events held regularly on the show include Celebrity Jeopardy!, in which celebrities and other notable individuals compete for charitable organizations of their choice;[103] and Kids Week, a special competition for school-age children aged 10 through 12.[104]Three International Tournaments, held in 1996, 1997, and 2001, featured one-week competitions among champions from each of the international versions of Jeopardy!. Each of the countries that aired their own version of the show in those years could nominate a contestant. The format was identical to the semifinals and finals of other Jeopardy! tournaments.[42][87] In 1996 and 1997, the winner received $25,000; in 2001, the top prize was doubled to $50,000. The 1997 tournament was recorded in Stockholm on the set of the Swedish version of Jeopardy!, and is significant for being the first week of Jeopardy! episodes to be taped in a foreign country.[42]There have been a number of special tournaments featuring the greatest contestants in Jeopardy! history. The first of these \"all-time best\" tournaments, Super Jeopardy!, aired in the summer of 1990 on ABC, and featured 37 top contestants from the previous seasons of the Trebek version and one notable champion from the original Jeopardy! series competing for a top prize of $250,000.[80] In 1993, that year's Tournament of Champions was followed by a Tenth Anniversary Tournament conducted over five episodes.[105] In May 2002, to commemorate the Trebek version's 4,000th episode, the show invited fifteen champions to play for a $1 million prize in the Million Dollar Masters tournament, which took place at Radio City Music Hall in New York City.[106] The Ultimate Tournament of Champions aired in 2005 and pitted 145 former Jeopardy! champions against each other, with two winners moving on to face Ken Jennings in a three-game final for $2,000,000, the largest prize in the show's history;[80] overall, the tournament spanned 15 weeks and 76 episodes, starting on February 9 and ending on May 25.[107] In 2014, Jeopardy! commemorated the 30th anniversary of the Trebek version with a Battle of the Decades tournament, in which 15 champions apiece from the first, second, and third decades of Jeopardy! '​s daily syndicated history competed for a grand prize of $1,000,000.[108]In November 1998, Jeopardy! traveled to Boston to reassemble 12 past Teen Tournament contestants for a special Teen Reunion Tournament.[58] Then in 2008, the show began its 25th season by reuniting 15 players from the first two Kids Weeks to compete in a special reunion tournament of their own.[109] During the next season (2009–10), a special edition of Celebrity Jeopardy!, called the Million Dollar Celebrity Invitational, was played in which twenty-seven contestants from past celebrity episodes competed for a grand prize of $1,000,000 for charity; the grand prize was won by Michael McKean.[110]The IBM Challenge aired February 14–16, 2011, and featured IBM's Watson computer facing off against Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter in a two-game match played over three shows.[111] This was the first man-vs.-machine competition in Jeopardy!'s history.[112] Watson won both the first game and the overall match to win the grand prize of $1 million, which IBM divided between two charities (World Vision International and World Community Grid).[113] Jennings, who won $300,000 for second place, and Rutter, who won the $200,000 third-place prize, both pledged to donate half of their winnings to charity.[114] The competition brought the show its highest ratings since the Ultimate Tournament of Champions.[115]Jeopardy!'s record for the longest winning streak is held by Ken Jennings, who competed on the show from June 2 through November 30, 2004, winning 74 matches before being defeated by Nancy Zerg in his 75th appearance. He amassed $2,520,700 over his 74 wins and a $2,000 second-place prize in his 75th appearance. At the time, he held the record as the highest money-winner ever on American game shows, and his winning streak increased the show's ratings and popularity to the point where it became TV's highest-rated syndicated program.[116] Jennings later won the $500,000 second-place prize in the Ultimate Tournament of Champions, the $300,000 second-place prize in the IBM Challenge, and the $100,000 second-place prize in the Battle of the Decades.The biggest all-time money winner on Jeopardy! is Brad Rutter, who has won a cumulative total of $4,355,102.[117] He became an undefeated champion in 2000 and later won an unprecedented four Jeopardy! tournaments: the 2001 Tournament of Champions,[118] the 2002 Million Dollar Masters Tournament, the 2005 Ultimate Tournament of Champions,[119] and the 2014 Battle of the Decades. Rutter broke Jennings's record for all-time game show winnings when he defeated Jennings and Jerome Vered in the Ultimate Tournament of Champions finals. Jennings regained the record through appearances on various other game shows, culminating in an appearance on Are You Smarter than a 5th Grader? on October 10, 2008. In 2014, Rutter regained the title after winning $1,000,000 in the Battle of the Decades, defeating Jennings and Roger Craig in the finals.Craig is the holder of the all-time record for single-day winnings on Jeopardy!. On the episode that aired September 14, 2010, he amassed a score of $47,000 after the game's first two rounds, then wagered and won an additional $30,000 in the Final Jeopardy! round, finishing with $77,000. The previous single-day record of $75,000 had been set by Jennings.[120]The record-holder among female contestants on Jeopardy!—in both number of games and total winnings—is Julia Collins, who amassed $429,100 over 21 games between April 21 and June 2, 2014. She won $428,100 in her 20 games as champion, plus $1,000 for finishing third in her twenty-first game.[121] Collins also achieved the second-longest winning streak on the show, behind Ken Jennings. The streak, which was interrupted in May by the Battle of the Decades, was broken by Brian Loughnane.[122][123]The highest one-day score in a Celebrity Jeopardy! tournament was achieved by comedian Andy Richter during a first round game of the 2009–10 season's \"Million Dollar Celebrity Invitational\", in which he finished with $68,000 for his selected charity, the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.[124]Three contestants on the Trebek version have won a game with the lowest amount possible ($1). The first was U.S. Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Darryl Scott, on the episode that aired January 19, 1993;[125] the second was Benjamin Salisbury, on a Celebrity Jeopardy! episode that aired April 30, 1997;[126] and the third was Brandi Chastain, on the Celebrity Jeopardy! episode that aired February 9, 2001.[127]Jeopardy! has been featured in a number of films, television shows and books over the years, mostly with one or more characters participating as contestants, or viewing and interacting with the game show from their own homes.Over the years, the Jeopardy! brand has been licensed for various products. From 1964 through 1976, Milton Bradley issued annual board games based on the original Fleming version. The Trebek version has been adapted into board games released by Pressman Toy Corporation, Tyco Toys, and Parker Brothers.[140] In addition, Jeopardy! has been adapted into a number of video games released on various consoles and handhelds spanning multiple hardware generations, starting with a Nintendo Entertainment System game released in 1987.[141] The show has also been adapted for personal computers, Facebook,[142] Twitter, Android, and the Roku Channel Store.[143]A DVD titled Jeopardy!: An Inside Look at America's Favorite Quiz Show, released by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment on November 8, 2005, features five memorable episodes of the Trebek version (the 1984 premiere, Ken Jennings' final game, and the three finals matches of the Ultimate Tournament of Champions)[144] and three featurettes discussing the show's history and question selection process.[145] Other products featuring the Jeopardy! brand include a collectible watch, a series of daily desktop calendars, and various slot machine games for casinos and the Internet.Jeopardy! '​s official website, active as early as 1998,[146] receives over 400,000 monthly visitors.[147] The website features videos, photographs, and other information related to each week's contestants, as well as mini-sites promoting remote tapings and special tournaments. As the show changes its main title card and corresponding graphics with every passing season, the Jeopardy! website is re-skinned to reflect the changes, and the general content of the site (such as online tests and promotions, programming announcements, \"spotlight\" segments, photo galleries, and downloadable content) is regularly updated to align with producers' priorities for the show.[148] In its 2012 \"Readers Choice Awards\", About.com praised the official Jeopardy! website for featuring \"everything [visitors] need to know about the show, as well as some fun interactive elements\", and for having a humorous error page.[149]In November 2009, Jeopardy! launched a viewer loyalty program called the \"Jeopardy! Premier Club\", which allowed home viewers to identify Final Jeopardy! categories from episodes for a chance to earn points, and play a weekly Jeopardy! game featuring categories and clues from the previous week's episodes. Every three months, players were selected randomly to advance to one of three quarterly online tournaments; after these tournaments were played, the three highest scoring players would play one final online tournament for the chance to win $5,000 and a trip to Los Angeles to attend a taping of Jeopardy![150] The Premier Club was discontinued by July 2011.[151]There is an unofficial Jeopardy! fansite known as the \"J! Archive\" (j-archive.com), which transcribes games from throughout Jeopardy! '​s daily syndicated history. In the archive, episodes are covered by Jeopardy!-style game boards with panels which, when hovered over with a mouse, reveal the correct response to their corresponding clues and the contestant who gave the correct response. The site makes use of a \"wagering calculator\" that helps potential contestants determine what amount is safest to bet during Final Jeopardy!, and an alternative scoring method called \"Coryat scoring\" that disregards wagering during Daily Doubles or Final Jeopardy! and gauges one's general strength at the game. The site's main founding archivist is Robert Knecht Schmidt, a student from Cleveland, Ohio,[152] who himself appeared as a Jeopardy! contestant in March 2010.[153] Before J! Archive, there was an earlier Jeopardy! fansite known as the \"Jeoparchive\", created by Season 19 contestant Ronnie O'Rourke, who managed and updated the site until Jennings' run made her disillusioned with the show.[152]","title":"","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ce/Jeopardy%21_logo.png/250px-Jeopardy%21_logo.png","developer":"","genre":""},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeopardy!_(video_game)","description":"Jeopardy! is an American television quiz show created by Merv Griffin, in which contestants are presented with clues in the form of answers, and must phrase their responses in the form of a question. Over the years, the show has expanded its brand beyond television and been licensed into products of various formats.In 1990, host Alex Trebek co-authored The Jeopardy! Book along with Peter Barsocchini, which included boards from some of their past tournament games as well as boards specializing in some of the show's various categories. (Trebek also voiced the audiobook, which featured the \"behind the scenes\" material on tape one, and audio versions of select games from the book on tape two.) Its sequel The Jeopardy! Challenge, also co-authored by Trebek, along with Griffin, included boards from their past tournament games, and was published in 1992.In 2000, the show's writers released 4 volumes of quiz books titled Jeopardy!: What is Quiz Book 1-4?, each featuring more than 300 pages worth of Jeopardy! boards from Seasons 14-17.In 2004, Barnes & Noble published This is Jeopardy!: Celebrating America's Favorite Quiz Show. Written by Ray Richmond, it featured selected Final Jeopardy! answers and questions from each of the show's first twenty seasons, plus trivia and other notable facts about the show.A number of unauthorized books have been published about Jeopardy!, written by people with ties to the show: Inside Jeopardy!: What Really Goes on at TV's Top Quiz Show (1993), written by former Jeopardy! writer and producer Harry Eisenberg, was reissued in 1995 as Jeopardy!: A Revealing Look Inside TV's Top Quiz Show with several allegations of scandal removed; Secrets of the Jeopardy! Champions (1992), written by Tournament of Champions winners Chuck Forrest and Mark Lowenthal, and How to Get on Jeopardy! and Win! (1998), written by Tournament of Champions winner Michael Dupée, serve as preparation aids for the Jeopardy! contestant hopeful; and Brainiac: Adventures in the Curious, Competitive, Compulsive World of Trivia Buffs (2006), by 74-game winner Ken Jennings and Prisoner of Trebekistan: A Decade in Jeopardy! (2006), written by comedian and former contestant Bob Harris, provide the insights of the extensive Jeopardy! experiences of two other notable champions who subsequently became authors of several books each.The earliest board games based on Jeopardy! were produced by Milton Bradley, which produced thirteen such games throughout the course of the original Fleming version's run (issued annually from 1964 through 1976); these games were numbered 1–12 and 14, skipping 13.The Trebek version has also seen various board game adaptations of its own. Pressman Toy Corporation first marketed several versions in the mid-to-late 1980s (including a version with electric signal devices and scoring consoles, released in 1987, and a \"25th Anniversary Edition\" to mark the anniversary of the original Art Fleming version debut (with special games featuring questions relating to the 1960s, in addition to new questions). Later versions were produced in the early 2000s, including a standard version, an all-Simpsons version, and most-recently an ESPN all-sports version (in both standard and \"travel folio\" versions) which, like the 1987 version before it, features an electronic buzz-in console. Tyco Toys and Parker Brothers have also manufactured their own board game adaptations of the Trebek version of Jeopardy![1]Jeopardy! has been adapted into a number of video games released on various consoles and handhelds spanning multiple hardware generations.[2] Most Jeopardy! games released prior to 1998 were published by GameTek, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection that year.An Atari 2600 adaptation of Jeopardy! was planned by The Great Game Co. in 1983, but that game ended up being cancelled during development.[3] Then, from 1987 to 1990, Rare Ltd. developed a series of three Jeopardy! games for the Nintendo Entertainment System. The first featured general knowledge questions,[4] the second was a \"Kids Edition\" featuring easier questions and child contestants,[5] and the third was an \"Anniversary Edition\" honoring the 25th anniversary of the original Art Fleming version's debut.[6] The Super Jeopardy! specials were also given a video game adaptation of their own for the NES, titled Talking Super Jeopardy! because of its periodic use of voice synthesis.[7]In 1992, GameTek released Jeopardy! video games for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System[8] and the Sega Genesis.[9] These two games were followed up by \"Sports Editions\"[10][11] and \"Deluxe Editions\" in 1994.[12][13] Then in 1994, Sony Imagesoft created a game based on the show for the Sega CD,[14] while Philips Interactive Media released a version for its CD-i console the following year.[15] GameTek's last Jeopardy! video game before its bankruptcy was released in 1998 for the Nintendo 64.[16]Hasbro Interactive produced two Jeopardy! video game adaptations of its own for Sony Computer Entertainment's PlayStation console in 1998 and 1999; both versions feature clues that are read by announcer Johnny Gilbert instead of host Alex Trebek;[17] while the second edition features behind-the-scenes interviews, an all-access backstage video, and a qualifying exam for contestants.[18] Afterwards, Hasbro Interactive's successor, Infogrames Entertainment (which would later go on to become Atari, SA), released a PlayStation 2 edition in October 2003.[19] Then in 2008, Sony Online Entertainment created a Jeopardy! game for the PlayStation 3 through the PlayStation Network.[20]On November 2, 2010, THQ released Jeopardy! video games for Nintendo's Wii console[21] and DS portable game system.[22] The company followed those up in 2012 by releasing games based on the show for the PlayStation 3, the Wii U,[23] and Microsoft's Xbox 360.A Game Boy version of Jeopardy! was released by GameTek in 1991,[24] and went on to spawn a \"Sports Edition.\"[25] Both versions were ported to the Game Boy's Sega rival, the Game Gear.[26][27] The gameplay in the Sports Edition is identical to the Super Nintendo and Genesis versions, though the portable versions lack the digitized voice and image of Alex Trebek and support only two players (where the console versions support three).[28] Tiger Electronics also released several Jeopardy! electronic games of its own, including a version for its Game.com system.[29] In 2004, Majesco Entertainment planned a port of Jeopardy! for Game Boy Color. However, the project was later cancelled.[30]In 2010, Sony Pictures Television, the show's production company, released an adaptation for the iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad.[31] The system was updated in 2012 with a number of online and local multiplayer modes.[32]Personal computers have seen many different adaptations of Jeopardy! The earliest was released in 1987 by Sharedata, which also released versions for the Apple II and the Commodore 64.[33] Sony Imagesoft later released its own PC version in 1994, along with the Sega CD version.[34] In 1998, shortly after GameTek's closure, Hasbro Interactive created a PC edition of Jeopardy!,[35] which was followed up by a version for Macintosh computers developed by MacSoft Games in 2000,[36] and later by an updated version published by Infogrames in 2003.[37] The show's latest PC adaptation was a \"Super Deluxe\" edition released by Encore, Inc. in 2008.[38]In April of 2011, GSN's interactive division teamed up with Sony Pictures Consumer Products to develop a Jeopardy! online game for Facebook,[39] but that game has since been taken down. As of March 2013, video game adaptations of Jeopardy! also exist on Twitter, Android, and the Roku Channel Store.[40]In 2002, in response to educators praising the longevity of the show's popularity and their students creating their own versions of the game to encourage student participation in class, educational toy company Educational Insights (which markets the GeoSafari system) released Classroom Jeopardy!, a self-contained, programmable game system based on Jeopardy! designed for use in schools.[41] With this system, the teacher plays the role of host, while students can play the game on a normal classroom television set or an interactive whiteboard. Teachers are permitted to either use standardized games created for the grade levels of their classes, or write customized games of their own covering material that they are teaching at the moment.[42] Originally, the game used a cartridge-based system for the categories and wireless remotes for the players and the host, with the unit itself acting as the scoreboard. There was also a small laptop-style keyboard that connected to the game unit and allowed for programming the cartridges via a small LCD screen on the unit. The uprated version of the system replaced the LCD screen and keyboard with a USB-connected device known as the \"Classroom Jeopardy! Link,\" which allowed programming of the cartridges (and storage of unused games) via a PC or Macintosh (which included \"Classroom Jeopardy! Editor\" software).The success of Classroom Jeopardy! led to the production of a home version, called Host Your Own Jeopardy!, which was released in 2004. Except for the names and included question content, this version was identical to the Classroom version. The Classroom edition featured one cartridge with 5 pre-programmed school-subject-based games; while the Host Your Own edition included four cartridges featuring 20 games used on the show, ranging from Kids Week level to Tournament Of Champions level. Educational Insights also produced additional scoreboards and controller units that could be connected to the main system and allow for more players per game (a maximum of nine additional scoreboards could be added, making for a maximum of 30 players/teams per game, although only the six highest-scoring players/teams could participate in Final Jeopardy!).In 2011, Educational Insights released an updated version of the Classroom Jeopardy! system. The updated system featured a restyling of the console and remotes, dry-erase Final Jeopardy! boards, and a host remote with LCD \"correct response\" display. Additional functions included the ability to enter players' names into the console, and more varied wagers for Daily Doubles and Final Jeopardy! Additionally, this system used USB Flash Drives in place of the cartridges to program the console (the system included a 512K Flash Drive, but other larger Flash Drives could also be used). This also makes the updated system capable of using audiovisual clues (such as audio and video clips, music cues, and still images), properly-formatted math equation clues, and foreign \"romance language\" characters. The new system is not backward-compatible with the older cartridges and accessories, but games written with the older system's software can be easily converted via the new system's \"Clue Studio\" program. The entirety of the new system also fits into an included storage suitcase, allowing for easier transport of the unit. Both editions of the game are still available through the company's website, although the older system's price has dropped substantially.[43][44]A DVD titled Jeopardy!: An Inside Look at America's Favorite Quiz Show was released on November 8, 2005 by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment. It features five of the most memorable episodes of the Trebek version: the very first Trebek episode in 1984, Episode #4657 (Ken Jennings' losing episode), and Episodes #4781, #4782, and #4783 (the three finals games of the Ultimate Tournament of Champions, the last of which can be viewed through multiple camera angles),[45] and there are also three featurettes: 21 Years of Answers and Questions, which discusses the show's history; and Jeopardy!: Behind the Answers and What Does It Take to Get a Clue?, both of which discuss the show's question selection process.[46] The DVD also features some funny moments from the show, including Trebek presenting the beginning of the first show of the Ultimate Tournament of Champions Finals without trousers, and Johnny Gilbert mistaking Trebek for contestant coordinator Glenn Kagan, who rehearses as him; both of these are Easter eggs displayed as the show's trademark \"Daily Doubles\". The DVD's menu is displayed as the show's trademark game board, with the menu options as \"categories\"; picking one of these causes the board to load up, complete with sound effect, similar to the show.[47]In 2007, MGA Entertainment released the Jeopardy! DVD Home Game System, which allows groups of players to play the game of Jeopardy! from home with a similar experience to appearing on the actual show.[48]For the show's 15th anniversary season in 1998-1999, a collectible watch was released. It plays the show's theme song, \"Think!\", with a push of a button, and includes 25 game cards with the answer-question format.

WildC.A.T.s is about the universal war between two prehistoric alien races. One of the races is the heroic Kherubim while the other is the evil Daemonites.[1]The WildC.A.T.s television series was created in 1994 and aired on CBS. The series was produced by WildStorm Productions in association with Nelvana. Although DC Comics owns the rights to the characters (due to DC's 1999 purchase of WildStorm), FUNimation Entertainment distributed the series' run on DVD, which was released on July 19, 2005.It ran for thirteen episodes with a family-friendly storyline. WildC.A.T.s featured a rock soundtrack, and a theme song performed by Sheree Jeacocke and Gerry Mosby. WildC.A.T.s, along with Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Skeleton Warriors, was grouped into the \"Action Zone\" showcase that used a wraparound animated fly-though pre-credit sequence to bookend the three very different programs.[citation needed] The series was canceled around the same time that the \"Action Zone\" concept was officially retired (although TMNT retained the \"Action Zone\" credit sequence until the end of its run two years later).[citation needed]The group was composed of all the original WildC.A.T.s. The major villain was Helspont, and the Troika and the Coda were featured as supporting characters. Mr. Majestic also made appearances, though not as a member of the group.The main differences of the series and the comic books were:A video game based on the TV series was published by Playmates Interactive Entertainment in 1995 for Super NES, with Spartan, Warblade and Maul as the only playable characters.Also, Playmates Toys released a toyline based on the TV series. The characters featured in the toyline were Grifter, Helspont, Maul, Max Cash (as a Black Razor), Mister Majestic, Pike, Slag, Spartan, Void, Voodoo, Warblade, Zealot and a generic Daemonite.Four VHS tapes with two episodes each were released in the 1990s. Funimation released the complete series on DVD in July 2005.[2][3] It is now out of print, but a digital copy of the series is available through Amazon Instant Video at Amazon.com.","title":"","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/7e/Wild_C.A.T.s_cover_.jpg/250px-Wild_C.A.T.s_cover_.jpg","developer":"","genre":""},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Power:_The_Lost_Dimension_in_3-D","description":"Jim Power: The Lost Dimension in 3-D is a platform game designed by French developer Loriciel and published by Electro Brain for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and the PC (DOS) in 1993.Jim Power: The Lost Dimension in 3-D is often considered by gaming aficionados to be one of the most difficult games ever made.[1][2] Despite its name, it is an entirely 2D game, although the game uses many layers of parallax scrolling backgrounds moving in opposite directions to give a great sense of depth. Together with the 3D glasses that were packaged with the game, designed around the Pulfrich effect, this provided a unique \"3D\" experience for the time when polygonal 3D graphics were rudimentary and too expensive to implement. The 3D feeling could also be related to the overhead stages, showing rotating effects in the same vein than those depicted in similar games like Contra III: The Alien Wars.A version of this game was also developed for the Mega Drive/Genesis under the name Jim Power: The Arcade Game. However, despite being in an almost complete state, this title was never published and remained unreleased until a ROM image was eventually leaked. This unpublished version features all levels and can be finished, although only a single music track (once again, arranged by Chris Hulsbeck) is present in the whole game. Jim Power: The Arcade Game is mostly the same game as Jim Power: The Lost Dimension in 3-D, albeit with some minor graphical differences derived from technical aspects. All the top-view stages were also replaced by additional shoot' em up levels, hence the rebranded title of this version depicting a further arcade experience rather than a \"3D\" one.","title":"Jim Power: The Lost Dimension in 3-D","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c8/Jim_Power_-_The_Lost_Dimension_in_3-D_Coverart.png","developer":"Loriciel","genre":"Platform game"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Connors_Pro_Tennis_Tour","description":"Jimmy Connors Pro Tennis Tour (ジミーコナーズのプロテニスツアー, Jimī Konāzu no Puro Tenisu Tsuā?) is a video game developed by Blue Byte and released in 1993.

It was originally released for the Sega Mega Drive, before being ported to several other systems including an upgraded version for the Amiga. The Amiga and other home computer conversions were the responsibility of Ocean Software while the Super Nintendo Entertainment System version was that of Gremlin Interactive.It is the direct sequel to Desert Strike: Return to the Gulf (a best-seller released the previous year) and is the second instalment in the Strike series. The game is a helicopter based shoot 'em up, mixing action and strategy. Jungle Strike retained its predecessor's core mechanics and expanded on the model with additional vehicles and settings. The plot concerns two villains intent on destroying Washington, D.C.. The player must use the helicopter and occasionally other vehicles to thwart their plans. The game was critically acclaimed, with some reviewers awarding scores upwards of 90%. Publications praised its gameplay, strategy, design, controls and graphics, although there were some complaints regarding the interface, difficulty and perceived jingoistic politics.Jungle Strike features two antagonists: Ibn Kilbaba, the son of Desert Strike's antagonist,[1] and Carlos Ortega, a notorious South American drug lord.[2] The opening sequence depicts the two men observing a nuclear explosion on a deserted island, while discussing the delivery of \"nuclear resources\" and an attack on Washington D.C.; Kilbaba seeks revenge for his father's death at the hands of the US, while Ortega wishes to \"teach the Yankees to stay out of my drug trade\".[3]Jungle Strike is a helicopter-based shoot 'em up,[4] mixing action and strategy.[5] The player's main weapon is a Comanche attack helicopter. Additional vehicles can be commandeered: a motorbike, hovercraft and F-117.[6] The latter in particular features variable height and unlimited ammunition,[5] but is more vulnerable to crashes.[7] The game features an \"overhead\" perspective \"with a slight 3D twist\".[8]Jungle Strike is the sequel to Desert Strike: Return to the Gulf, a similar game which parodied the Gulf War[10] and which was released in 1992. Desert Strike arose from a failed attempt at a flight simulator and was inspired by Matchbox toys and Choplifter. Central to the game's concept were nonlinear gameplay and the eschewing of power-ups and bosses. With the success of the original title, producer Scott Berfield, game director John Manley and associate producer Tony Barnes were tasked with creating the sequel. Jungle Strike retained the core mechanics of its predecessor,[11] with the addition of various vehicles and settings. Desert Strike was at the time Electronic Arts' highest selling video game[12] and maintained a high sales chart position as Jungle Strike was released in 1993.[13]The Amiga conversion of Desert Strike featured upgraded graphics and sound over the Mega Drive original.[14] With regards to the Jungle Strike Amiga conversion, senior programmer Stuart Johnson stated he \"tried to keep this conversion a lot more faithful to the Mega Drive version than Desert Strike was\". He attempted to make the Amiga conversion run more smoothly than the Mega Drive original. Graphical improvements were attempted: these were less successful on the A500 than the A1200 because of technical restrictions. The developers also struggled with technical challenges because of differences in hardware between the Mega Drive and Amiga. Amendments were also made to the workings of in-mission plot screens.[15] The Amiga conversion was released as sequel Urban Strike was published for the Mega Drive in 1994.[16]Jungle Strike was followed by three further sequels: Urban Strike, Soviet Strike, and Nuclear Strike. As the series moved to more advanced consoles, series creator Mike Posehn became less involved in the programming side of development.[11] Urban Strike, released for the Mega Drive, featured new vehicles and locations,[10] as well as on-foot sections.[5] Soviet Strike, released for Sony's PlayStation and the Sega Saturn in 1996,[17][18] featured 3D graphics,[10] as did Nuclear Strike, released on PC and PlayStation in 1997 and the Nintendo 64 in 1999.[10][19][20][21] Another sequel provisionally titled Future Strike was planned,[21] but the game was eventually released as Future Cop: LAPD, a mech-based shooter game.[22]The New Straits Times praised the \"simply wonderful\" graphics but questioned whether the sound effects were enough to \"create the environment of a full-scale war\". The newspaper pointed to a high initial difficulty but said: \"Once the skills are acquired, be ready for many hours of enjoyment and sleepless nights.\"[27] Chip and Jonathan Carter deemed the Mega Drive game one of the best of the year and felt the SNES version \"loses nothing in the translation\". The duo said the Game Boy and Game Gear versions were \"less impressive\" because of technical restrictions but \"about as good as you can get on the small screen\".[28] Amiga CD32 Gamer called Jungle Strike \"a 500lb gorilla among games\" and praised its ease of control and \"masses of gameplay and realistic detail\".[29]Amiga Computing said: \"With its impressive graphics and superbly designed game system, it could well be the best chopper title yet\" although the reviewer felt the difficulty curve was too steep.[30] Amiga Format said of the game: \"with a little more foresight and planning, it could have been a lot more fun\", as the reviewer was irritated by the fact that fuel, armour and ammunition levels were displayed on map screen. However the magazine also wrote: \"The bottom line though, is that Jungle Strike is an incredibly good game\".[6] Amiga Power called the game \"an appreciable shoot 'em up\" but said it was \"clearly tailored for the shorter attention span\" of a console gamer.[7] CU Amiga Magazine wrote: \"This blend of shooting and thinking action blends together seamlessly and in the process creates a classic blaster well worth a ride\".[5] The One Amiga magazine wrote: \"Jungle Strike's a fine game, which will prove both a challenge for Desert Strike-ophiles, and a good solid blast for first bloods\".[16] ACAR noted the game's \"Good graphics, okay sound, smooth animation and tough game play.\"[31] Amiga Power complained that \"Throughout the game you're battered with uneasily right-wing US politics\",[7] while Amiga Format said \"jingoism\" was \"rife\" throughout the game.[4] Amiga CD32 Gamer called the plot \"typically 'ugly American' idiocy\".[29]","title":"Jungle Strike","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/ff/Jungle_strike_cover.png/250px-Jungle_strike_cover.png","developer":"Electronic Arts","genre":"Shoot 'em up"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurassic_Park_(Super_NES_video_game)","description":"Jurassic Park is an action-adventure video game for the Super NES based on the movie adaptation of the book by Michael Crichton.In the game, the player controls Alan Grant, and the objective of the game is to complete certain tasks in order to escape, such as clearing a raptor nest of eggs, and turning the generator on in a utility shed, allowing for opening and closing of gates and the like. Communication ports set up around the island allow characters in the game to communicate advice to the player, though some advice is deliberately malicious. Jurassic Park supports the SNES Mouse when playing first-person sequences or operating computer terminals. The game's soundtrack consists of various music that corresponds to the area the player is currently exploring (except the two Tyrannosaurus rex who have their own theme track). The game typically takes anywhere from two to three hours to complete. Some objectives, such as collecting all 18 raptor eggs, can slow down the progress of a typical player. There is no way to save the game, however, there are an unlimited number of continues available. The player, therefore, is required to play through the entire game in a single sitting.Other games named Jurassic Park exist on the NES, Game Boy, Sega Genesis, Sega Game Gear, DOS, and the Commodore Amiga. No two games feature the same kind of gameplay, though they focus on roughly the same storyline. All versions, excluding those on the Sega Genesis, Game Gear and Sega CD, were developed and published by Ocean Software.An unlicenced NES port of the game titled \"The Lost World: Jurassic Park\" exists and retains most of the mechanics and the first-person segments. However the objective in that version is to collect all the Jurassic Park tokens scattered across the game and find key-cards in order to reach the rooftop of a building and collect all the dinosaur eggs there.[citation needed]","title":"Jurassic Park","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/67/Jurassic_Park_%28SNES%29_Coverart.png/250px-Jurassic_Park_%28SNES%29_Coverart.png","developer":"Ocean Software","genre":"Science fiction"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurassic_Park_2:_The_Chaos_Continues","description":"Jurassic Park Part 2: The Chaos Continues is a video game, a non-canonical continuation of the Jurassic Park series for the SNES and Game Boy.

The fictitious players have the same statistics as their real-world counterparts, and the game comes with a name-changing feature that allows players to change the athletes' names. Nintendo released a portable version of the game in 1997 for the Game Boy with real players and stats from the 1996 season. The gameplay is similar to its predecessors, though it is sometimes sluggish due to hardware restrictions. The SNES version came with a promotional Ken Griffey, Jr. collector's card packed inside[1] and was a major commercial success, with 1.2 million units sold.[2]Ken Griffey, Jr. Presents Major League Baseball received generally mixed reviews. GamePro heavily criticized the game's lack of realism, citing the fictitious players, inaccurate ballparks, inability to adjust defense, \"stylized\" player sprites, and the ability to control the ball even after it leaves the pitcher's hand. However, they acknowledged the game has good music, \"one of the best manuals for a baseball game\", and gameplay that is very accessible to beginners.[5] Electronic Gaming Monthly criticized that the computer is too difficult to beat in one-player mode, but praised the digitized voice of Steve Palermo and the general playability.

Kick Off, the first game of the series, was designed by Dino Dini and released by Anco for the Amiga and the Atari ST in 1989. The game was received well by the games industry at the time and won awards.After the release of Kick Off several sequels were released. Player Manager was released in 1990. The game was the first game to combine a management environment (including tactics, league play, transfers, and detailed player attributes) with a football game engine (based on that of Kick Off). Kick Off 2 was released in 1990 as a sequel to Kick Off. The game introduced a number of new features as well as several small alterations.In 1992, Dino Dini left Anco and signed a contract for Virgin Games, which released Goal! in 1993. Anco released several further editions of the Kick Off series between 1994 and 1997, but these games had little in common with Kick Off and Kick Off 2. In 2001–2003, the KOA collaborated closely with Anco developer Steve Screech in an attempt to relaunch the Kick Off and Player Manager series. Kick Off 2002 was released. Anco started to work on another sequel Kick Off 2004 which reached beta status. The attempt came to a halt when Anco closed in 2003.Beginning in 2001, annual Kick Off 2 World Cups have been organized by the Kick Off Association (KOA), a fan community devoted to the Kick Off series.Kick Off was released in 1989. Several expansion disks were released for Kick Off 2.Anco released Kick Off 3 in 1994. The game used a side view instead of a top-down view and bore little resemblance to Kick Off 2 apart from the name.Anco published the first versions of Kick Off for the Amiga and Atari ST.[1]With Kick Off the ball did not stick to the player's feet but instead was realistically kicked ahead from the players, in a manner similar to that of Nintendo's Soccer, released in 1985 on the NES. This added a degree of difficulty and skill requirement at the same time. Other attributes, such as action replays, players with different characteristics, different tactics, fouls, yellow cards, red cards, injuries, injury time and various referees with different moods also featured..Kick Off was first developed for the Atari ST and then ported to the Amiga.[2] Kick Off enthusiasts still play tournaments on original Amiga computers every year.In 1990, Kick Off 2 was released by Anco. Kick Off 2 retains the pace and accuracy of Kick Off, with a full size multi directional scrolling pitch and the players, markings, goals etc., in correct proportions. Both teams play the game strictly according to tactics. Players move into position to receive passes and gain possession. The ball, as in real game, travels ahead of the player.The special events selection in the main menu allows data disks to be loaded. Kick Off 2 also provides the facility to change strip colours and on expanded Atari ST's (1 MB or above) there are additional sound effects. The \"Action Replay\" facility allows goals to be viewed at normal pace or in \"Slow Motion\" and saved to disk. There are 24 referees and have their own distinctive temperaments.[4]Super Kick Off is one of the follow-ups of Kick Off and Kick Off 2 for Game Boy, SEGA and SNES.[5] Super Kick Off was slower than the original games.[6] The Mega Drive version knocked PGA Tour Golf II from the top of the charts.[7] MegaTech gave the game 94% and a Hyper Game Award, saying that the \"feel and playability is unrivalled by any other footy game so far\", but criticising the high price of £45.[8]In 1992, a sequel, Kick Off 3, was in development. The game wasn't released in this form though, as Dino Dini left Anco in 1992 for Virgin Games, where he developed Goal!, released in 1993. Goal! featured similar gameplay to Kick Off 2 but also added one-touch passing as seen in Sensible Soccer, player acceleration, and more advanced menu systems and options. Goal! received generally good reviews but did not enjoy the same lasting popularity as Kick Off 2.In 1994, Anco released Kick Off 3 developed by Steve Screech, a totally new game with nothing in common with Kick Off 2. The game didn't receive as good reviews as its predecessors and didn't gain the same popularity.[9]In 1996, Toka Nono released Kick Off 96 for Amiga and Windows. The game received average reviews.[10] In 1997, Kick Off 97 was released for Windows. The game received better reviews than Kick Off 96 but still didn't become popular.[11] Later the same year, Anco released Kick Off 98 for the PC which received poor reviews.[12] In 1998 Kick Off World was released for the PlayStation 1, again developed by Toka and published by Funsoft.In 2001, Steve Screech started a project called Ultimate Kick Off with the help of an early established Kick Off Association. The game was released by Anco in 2002 for PC and Mac[13] with the name Kick Off 2002. The game received poor reviews and only sold 5000 copies.[14][15] Later a sequel called Kick Off 2004 was planned. It reached beta status but it was never released. The project ended when Anco closed in 2003.Kick Off series include the following games:[16]In 2005, Steve Camber started his project called Kick Off 2 competition version. A mod of the classic game for Amiga to improve its features using reverse engineering of the original Amiga game.The Three times Kick Off 2 World Champion Gianluca Troiano started a project called Throw In in 2004. The game is a remake of Kick Off 2 but with a 3D engine. The fast action gameplay with Kick Off 2 gameplay is remained but with possibility to watch the match and replays from infinitive views and a new GFX engine. In cooperation with Kick Off Association several betaversions were released during the 00s. Throw In has been praised by the Kick Off programmer Dino Dini[20][21][22]In 2012 the developers behind Throw In announced that the game Active Soccer will be released. The game is a further development of the Throw In betaversions. It will at first be released for Iphone and Ipad.

Kick Off, the first game of the series, was designed by Dino Dini and released by Anco for the Amiga and the Atari ST in 1989. The game was received well by the games industry at the time and won awards.After the release of Kick Off several sequels were released. Player Manager was released in 1990. The game was the first game to combine a management environment (including tactics, league play, transfers, and detailed player attributes) with a football game engine (based on that of Kick Off). Kick Off 2 was released in 1990 as a sequel to Kick Off. The game introduced a number of new features as well as several small alterations.In 1992, Dino Dini left Anco and signed a contract for Virgin Games, which released Goal! in 1993. Anco released several further editions of the Kick Off series between 1994 and 1997, but these games had little in common with Kick Off and Kick Off 2. In 2001–2003, the KOA collaborated closely with Anco developer Steve Screech in an attempt to relaunch the Kick Off and Player Manager series. Kick Off 2002 was released. Anco started to work on another sequel Kick Off 2004 which reached beta status. The attempt came to a halt when Anco closed in 2003.Beginning in 2001, annual Kick Off 2 World Cups have been organized by the Kick Off Association (KOA), a fan community devoted to the Kick Off series.Kick Off was released in 1989. Several expansion disks were released for Kick Off 2.Anco released Kick Off 3 in 1994. The game used a side view instead of a top-down view and bore little resemblance to Kick Off 2 apart from the name.Anco published the first versions of Kick Off for the Amiga and Atari ST.[1]With Kick Off the ball did not stick to the player's feet but instead was realistically kicked ahead from the players, in a manner similar to that of Nintendo's Soccer, released in 1985 on the NES. This added a degree of difficulty and skill requirement at the same time. Other attributes, such as action replays, players with different characteristics, different tactics, fouls, yellow cards, red cards, injuries, injury time and various referees with different moods also featured..Kick Off was first developed for the Atari ST and then ported to the Amiga.[2] Kick Off enthusiasts still play tournaments on original Amiga computers every year.In 1990, Kick Off 2 was released by Anco. Kick Off 2 retains the pace and accuracy of Kick Off, with a full size multi directional scrolling pitch and the players, markings, goals etc., in correct proportions. Both teams play the game strictly according to tactics. Players move into position to receive passes and gain possession. The ball, as in real game, travels ahead of the player.The special events selection in the main menu allows data disks to be loaded. Kick Off 2 also provides the facility to change strip colours and on expanded Atari ST's (1 MB or above) there are additional sound effects. The \"Action Replay\" facility allows goals to be viewed at normal pace or in \"Slow Motion\" and saved to disk. There are 24 referees and have their own distinctive temperaments.[4]Super Kick Off is one of the follow-ups of Kick Off and Kick Off 2 for Game Boy, SEGA and SNES.[5] Super Kick Off was slower than the original games.[6] The Mega Drive version knocked PGA Tour Golf II from the top of the charts.[7] MegaTech gave the game 94% and a Hyper Game Award, saying that the \"feel and playability is unrivalled by any other footy game so far\", but criticising the high price of £45.[8]In 1992, a sequel, Kick Off 3, was in development. The game wasn't released in this form though, as Dino Dini left Anco in 1992 for Virgin Games, where he developed Goal!, released in 1993. Goal! featured similar gameplay to Kick Off 2 but also added one-touch passing as seen in Sensible Soccer, player acceleration, and more advanced menu systems and options. Goal! received generally good reviews but did not enjoy the same lasting popularity as Kick Off 2.In 1994, Anco released Kick Off 3 developed by Steve Screech, a totally new game with nothing in common with Kick Off 2. The game didn't receive as good reviews as its predecessors and didn't gain the same popularity.[9]In 1996, Toka Nono released Kick Off 96 for Amiga and Windows. The game received average reviews.[10] In 1997, Kick Off 97 was released for Windows. The game received better reviews than Kick Off 96 but still didn't become popular.[11] Later the same year, Anco released Kick Off 98 for the PC which received poor reviews.[12] In 1998 Kick Off World was released for the PlayStation 1, again developed by Toka and published by Funsoft.In 2001, Steve Screech started a project called Ultimate Kick Off with the help of an early established Kick Off Association. The game was released by Anco in 2002 for PC and Mac[13] with the name Kick Off 2002. The game received poor reviews and only sold 5000 copies.[14][15] Later a sequel called Kick Off 2004 was planned. It reached beta status but it was never released. The project ended when Anco closed in 2003.Kick Off series include the following games:[16]In 2005, Steve Camber started his project called Kick Off 2 competition version. A mod of the classic game for Amiga to improve its features using reverse engineering of the original Amiga game.The Three times Kick Off 2 World Champion Gianluca Troiano started a project called Throw In in 2004. The game is a remake of Kick Off 2 but with a 3D engine. The fast action gameplay with Kick Off 2 gameplay is remained but with possibility to watch the match and replays from infinitive views and a new GFX engine. In cooperation with Kick Off Association several betaversions were released during the 00s. Throw In has been praised by the Kick Off programmer Dino Dini[20][21][22]In 2012 the developers behind Throw In announced that the game Active Soccer will be released. The game is a further development of the Throw In betaversions. It will at first be released for Iphone and Ipad. It will have gameplay similar to Kick Off and original Throw In but adjusted to gamepad and keyboards.The Kick Off Association (K.O.A.) is a non-profit organization founded by Gunther Wening and Jan Tijssen in 2001 as an umbrella organization for fans of the series.[23]The Kick Off Association has approximately 1400 members.

It was released in North America in September 1994, Japan on October 21, 1994 and in Europe in 1994. The game features the Kid Klown, the player character who is tasked with rescuing the Princess Honey from the villain Black Jack. Players view gameplay from an isometric perspective as Kid Klown pursues a lit fuse in order to stop it from reaching a spade bomb. The game was re-released for the Game Boy Advance and features 11 new levels, four mini-games, and a multi-player mode. The re-release was released in Europe and North America in October 2002, while a release in Japan was planned but ultimately canceled. It was met with mixed reception from critics, who found it to be inferior to other games of its type.Kid Klown in Crazy Chase was developed and published by Kemco for the Super NES, Super Famicom and Game Boy Advance video game consoles. While the Super NES version was first released in Europe in 1994, in North America in September 1994, and in Japan on October 21, 1994, the Game Boy Advance re-release was released in October 21 and 23, 2002 in Europe and North America, respectively.[5][6] The Game Boy Advance version was first revealed at E3 2001, where Kemco commented that the current build was 60% complete and would be released in Summer 2001 for Japan and November 2001 for North America.[7] Both releases were delayed several times and the Japanese version ultimately canceled.[4][8][9] Before release, it was featured at both E3 2002 and the 2002 Tokyo Game Show.[10][11]Kid Klown in Krazy Chase received mixed reception. It holds an aggregate score of 64.17% on Game Rankings based on three reviews.[12] Author Andy Slaven wrote that the only problem with the game was its \"strange\" three-quarter perspective.[13] Nintendo Power gave it a 3.375 out of 5, while Electronic Gaming Monthly gave it a 7.5 out of 10.[14][15] IGN called the Super NES version overlooked and described it as a \"zany\" game that \"boasts stellar colors and some really frantic animation\".[8] Eurogamer's Tom Bramwell described the video game J.J. & Jeff as a \"poor man's Plok/Kid Klown in Crazy Chase/Putty Quest/etc\".[16] Edge compared Let's Tap to Kid Klown due to the similar challenges found in Let's Tap '​s multi-player mode.[17] Nintendo Life's Andrew Donaldson commented that while not a bad game, there's no reason to play it due to a lack of levels and an abundance of games that do what it does better.[18]","title":"Kid Klown in Crazy Chase","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/76/Kid_Klown_in_Crazy_Chase_box.png","developer":"Kemco","genre":"Platform game"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killer_Instinct_(1994_video_game)","description":"Killer Instinct is a fighting game developed by Rare and published by Midway and Nintendo. It was released as an arcade game in the summer of 1994 and, the following year, ported to the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) and the Game Boy. The game's plot involves an all-powerful corporation organizing a fighting tournament. The story was adapted in a limited comic book series published under the short-lived Acclaim Comics imprint.Killer Instinct features several gameplay elements unique to fighting games of the time. Instead of fighting enemies in best-of-three rounds bouts, each player has two life bars. The player that depletes the other player's life bars first wins the match. The game also introduced \"auto-seconds\", which allows players to press a certain sequence of buttons to make characters automatically perform combos on opponents. Also featured in the game are \"combo breakers\"; special moves that can interrupt combos.Critically acclaimed, Killer Instinct was followed by a sequel, the 1996 arcade game Killer Instinct 2, later ported to the Nintendo 64 as Killer Instinct Gold, as well as a 2013 revival of the franchise as a launch title for Xbox One. A port of the original game is included with the 2013 game under the title Killer Instinct Classic. Retrospective lists by various publications included it among the best fighting games of all time.Killer Instinct plays like many other fighting games, in which the player controls a character in order to beat an opponent in a one-on-one encounter. The game borrows the attack set of Street Fighter and is also inspired by the finishing moves from Mortal Kombat. There are also several features that distinguish it from other franchises:Ultratech is a very powerful megacorporation which organizes a tournament called Killer Instinct. Along with regular participants, experimental creatures created by Ultratech also fight in the tournament so their strength can be tested. Ultratech also discovers a technology to make bridges between dimensions, and releases a two-headed, one-eyed, satyr monster called Eyedol from this dimensional prison.According to GamePro in 2010, Killer Instinct is \"remembered for its colorful cast of combatants. KI featured a velociraptor, a sword-wielding skeleton, a creature made out of ice, and a host of other memorable characters.\"[1] In 2012, Topless Robot wrote that Killer Instinct \"featured one of the most amazing and varied cast of characters ever to grace a fighting game, including the Native American Chief Thunder, the demonic skeleton Spinal, fiery criminal Cinder, the killer cyborg Fulgore and the vicious velociraptor-hybrid Riptor.\"[2]In Spring 1994, Nintendo signed a licensing agreement with WMS Industries, Midway's parent company, which enabled Midway to develop and market arcade games using the \"Project Reality\" hardware (later to become the Nintendo 64) and formed a joint venture company called Williams/Nintendo to market Nintendo-exclusive home conversions of these games. Killer Instinct was announced as the first of these games.[3] The announcement came at a time when Nintendo was still known for its stance against violent video games. To avert speculation that Killer Instinct would not be as violent as the title suggests, Nintendo's director of marketing George Harrison stated that \"Williams would not have entered into this deal if they thought their hands would be tied. We won't restrict them in any way.\" He added that Nintendo felt that an industry-standard ratings system, which was expected to be in place by the time the home version was released, would make their stance against violent games no longer necessary.[3]Initially released to arcades in 1994, Killer Instinct did not actually run on Nintendo 64 hardware, but on proprietary arcade hardware co-developed by Rare and Midway, and created by Chris Stamper and Pete Cox.[citation needed] Despite this, the game's attract mode advertised the game as planned to be \"available for your home in 1995 only on Nintendo Ultra 64\", being \"Ultra 64\" the name intended at that point for what ended up being the Nintendo 64. Ultimately, the Nintendo 64's release was delayed and the game was ported to the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and the GameBoy instead.Killer Instinct was the first arcade game to use an internal hard disk drive in addition to the game's ROMs.[citation needed] This allowed it to store massive amounts of data thereby giving it the ability to have more detailed graphics than other games of this genre. The game used pre-rendered sprites for characters, created with Silicon Graphics computers and the backgrounds were pre-rendered as a \"movie\" which simply adjusted frames based on the players' current location.[4] Killer Instinct's R4600 processor was clocked at 100 MHz.[5]In the SNES port many of the features the arcade version were altered, downgraded, or removed. The graphic detail was vastly reduced and the character sprites were smaller. The stages with a 3D panning camera were simplified into a 2D panning view using parallax scrolling for the background and mode 7 for the ground or arena, thus simulating a pseudo-3D effect. Zooming and scaling were removed. Some of the stages were redesigned. The full motion videos that showed the characters after a victory were replaced by still images. Voice samples and sound effects were severely limited, whether shortened or missing altogether, and the music's quality was noticeably lower. Most of the characters preserved their special moves and danger moves. However, some of the special graphical effects — notably the shadow move effect — were removed. To make up for the loss of overall quality, some other modes were added, such as a training mode, a tournament mode (used for multi-player purposes), among others. When released in Europe, Japan, Australia, Canada and the United States, the SNES game had black cartridge casing, instead of the standard grey shell. The TV advertisement for Canada and the United States showed a person cutting through the arcade cabinet with a chainsaw to reveal an SNES console with the game plugged in.[6] Killer Cuts, an arranged soundtrack CD featuring original music from Killer Instinct was released as a pack-in for the SNES release of the game.A digital port of the game's arcade version, titled Killer Instinct Classic, is available as part of the \"Ultra Edition\" of Killer Instinct for the Xbox One. This port includes a number of additional features, such as a new training mode, unlockable character sprite galleries and cutscenes, several visual filters, and the ability to play the game in both its original 1.4 revision and its later 1.5D revision.[7] Killer Instinct Classic does not feature online multiplayer, though Microsoft is exploring the possibility of adding it post-launch.[8]Killer Instinct was a commercial hit and gained critical acclaim. The SNES version of the game was also well received upon its release, selling 3.2 million units.[9] VideoGames reviewer Tyrone Rodriguez gave the game a score of 8 (Great), stating his preference of it over Mortal Kombat 3 (the other editors' additional scores being 8–6–6).[10] Computer and Video Games gave the game a review score of 93%, adding: \"Rare weren't lying when they said the home version would play better than the coin-op: no-one realised they were talking about the SNES!\"[11]Retrospectively, Killer Instinct was ranked as the 148th best game made on any Nintendo system by Nintendo Power in 2006,[12] as well as the 95th on a similar list by Official Nintendo Magazine in 2009.[13] In platform-specific retro lists, it was also ranked as the 19th and 38th best SNES game of all time by ScrewAttack and GamesRadar respectively,[14][15] and as the 13th best arcade game of the 1990s by Complex.[16]Killer Instinct was included on several lists of top fighting games of all time, including by ScrewAttack in 2008 (ranked fifth best),[17] GamePro that same year (ranked 18th best),[18] and UGO in 2010 (ranked tenth best).[19] In 2004, GamesTM called it possibly \"the best combo-heavy fighter ever;\"[20] ranking it as the eighth top fighting game of all time in 2009, Virgin Media stated that Killer Instinct was \"most famous for having the longest combos in the business.\"[21] Killer Instinct was voted the sixth top 2D fighting game of all time by Crave Online users in 2007,[22] and ranked the sixth best 2D fighting game of all time by Complex in 2013.[23]A sequel titled Killer Instinct 2 was released in 1996. Like the first game, it was ported to a home console, this time to the Nintendo 64 as Killer Instinct Gold.A new Killer Instinct, published by Microsoft and developed by Double Helix Games with input from Rare, was released as a launch title for the Xbox One in 2013. The Ultra Edition of the game includes the Killer Instinct Classic port of the original arcade game.","title":"Killer Instinct","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/d7/Killer_Instinct_flyer.jpg","developer":"Rareware","genre":"Fighting game"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Arthur_%26_the_Knights_of_Justice_(video_game)","description":"King Arthur & the Knights of Justice is an action-adventure game developed by Manley & Associates and published by Enix for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in May 1995.

Almost everything in the stage (within the confines of the electrical barriers) can be destroyed. Vehicles such as helicopters, boats, and tanks can be picked up and thrown.On May 25, 1992, SNK and Takara released a sequel for the Neo-Geo. Takara also ported it to the Super NES in 1993. This sequel takes the original in a new direction by using three of the monsters from the original game as heroes in a side-scrolling beat 'em up. Geon, Astro Guy, and Woo are all upgraded to defend Earth against an alien threat led by a creature called Famardy. The game also features a 2-player competition mode.All the monsters had different names in the Japanese and American versions of the game.The Japanese cities of the first game have been abandoned in favor of more generic areas: American City, French City, Grand Canyon, Desert, Sea Bed, Volcano, and Hideout.A Genesis version of King of the Monsters 2 was developed by Betop and also released by Takara, but is somewhat different from the other two versions. Rather than being a beat 'em up, the Genesis version plays like a fighting game, similar to its predecessor.

It was almost always picked, leaving other games like ActRaiser, Super Ghouls 'n Ghosts, and El Viento out, this was the same on earlier broadcasts of Sky1 show Games World.","title":"","developer":"","genre":""},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirby_Super_Star","description":"","title":"Kirby Super Star\nKirby's Fun Pak","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/3a/Kirby_Super_Star_Coverart.png/250px-Kirby_Super_Star_Coverart.png","developer":"HAL Laboratory","genre":"Platforming"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirby%27s_Avalanche","description":"","title":"Kirby's Avalanche\nKirby's Ghost Trap","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/63/Kirby%27s_Avalanche_Coverart.png/250px-Kirby%27s_Avalanche_Coverart.png","developer":"HAL Laboratory","genre":"Puzzle"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirby%27s_Dream_Course","description":"","title":"Kirby's Dream Course","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/d8/Kirbydreamcourse.jpg/250px-Kirbydreamcourse.jpg","developer":"HAL Laboratory","genre":"Sports (Golf)"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirby%27s_Dream_Land_3","description":"","title":"Kirby's Dream Land 3","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/56/Kdl3.png/250px-Kdl3.png","developer":"HAL Laboratory","genre":"Platforming"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knights_of_the_Round_(video_game)","description":"Knights of the Round (Japanese: ナイツオブザラウンド?) is an arcade game released by Capcom in 1991.[1] A side-scrolling beat 'em up based loosely on the legend of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table, the game features a role-playing video game-like level advancement system, with fighters automatically being upgraded to new weapons and armour as they advance through the game.[2]Sinclair User scored the arcade version a 78/100, writing that players who enjoyed Golden Axe would enjoy Knights of the Round.[4] Anthony Baize, writing for Allgame called it a \"solid quarter muncher with some cool mythological characters.\"[2]","title":"Knights of the Round","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/dc/Knights.png/220px-Knights.png","developer":"Capcom","genre":"Beat 'em up"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krusty%27s_Super_Fun_House","description":"","title":"Krusty's Fun House","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/96/NES_Krusty%27s_Fun_House.jpg/200px-NES_Krusty%27s_Fun_House.jpg","developer":"Fox Williams","genre":"Puzzle"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Petty%27s_No_Fear_Racing","description":"","title":"Kyle Petty's No Fear Racing","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/64/KylePetty%27sNoFearRacingTitleScreen.jpg/250px-KylePetty%27sNoFearRacingTitleScreen.jpg","developer":"Leland Interactive Media","genre":"Racing"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagoon_(video_game)","description":"Lagoon (ラグーン?) is a top-view action/adventure video game for the Sharp X68000 and Super NES, in which Nasir (Nassel in the Japanese version), Champion of Light, must investigate the source of the world's corrupted water and return peace to Lakeland.Lagoon is an action role-playing game with a fantasy setting, very similar to the early Ys games, combining real-time action gameplay with RPG elements such as experience levels and equipment management.

It is the third installment in The Legend of Zelda series and was released in 1991 in Japan and 1992 in North America and Europe. Shigeru Miyamoto and his team were solely responsible for this game's development.Nintendo Power held a contest which selected a winner at random to appear in the next The Legend of Zelda game.[24] A certain single room in A Link to the Past contained a number of Rupees and a note bearing a greeting from Chris Houlihan, the winner of the contest. The room has been found through five different methods, and was intended as a crash prevention measure; the game would send players to this room if it couldn't determine where Link was going when he goes to another area.[25] The message reads: \"My name is Chris Houlihan. This is my top secret room. Keep it between us, okay?\"[26] The room was discovered more than a decade after the release of A Link to the Past after the increased popularity of the Internet and Super NES emulators.[27] The Game Boy Advance re-release of A Link to the Past titled The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past & Four Swords removed the ability to access the room, though it could still be found in the game's code.[24] The Virtual Console re-releases on the Wii and Wii U of A Link to the Past however allowed players to access the room.[27]The game was re-released for the Game Boy Advance in 2002 in North America and 2003 in other territories as part of The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past and Four Swords, a collaborative development effort between Nintendo and Capcom.[49] The port of A Link to the Past contains minor changes from the original, including the addition of vocal grunts and other sound effects taken from Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask.[50] Four Swords is a multi-player adventure that interacts with the single-player adventure. Accomplishments can be transferred between the two; for example, if the player learns a new sword technique, it is made available in both modes. By completing Four Swords, a new dungeon called the Palace of the Four Sword is unlocked in A Link to the Past.[51][52] Dungeons are randomly generated and are affected by the number of players.[53] If only two players are active, the game ensures that all puzzles generated do not require a third or fourth player to solve.[53] The plot of Four Swords revolves around the wind mage Vaati who escapes from the Four Sword he is sealed in and captures Princess Zelda to marry her. Link uses the Four Sword to create three copies of himself and rescues Zelda, trapping Vaati in the sword once again. At the time of its release, the story of Four Swords was considered the oldest tale in the series' timeline.[54]","title":"The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/21/The_Legend_of_Zelda_A_Link_to_the_Past_SNES_Game_Cover.jpg/250px-The_Legend_of_Zelda_A_Link_to_the_Past_SNES_Game_Cover.jpg","developer":"Nintendo EAD","genre":"Action-adventure"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemmings_(video_game)","description":"Lemmings is a puzzle-platformer video game originally developed by DMA Design and published by Psygnosis for the Amiga in 1991. The basic objective of the game is to guide a group of humanoid lemmings through a number of obstacles to a designated exit. In order to save the required number of lemmings to win, one must determine how to assign a limited number of eight different skills to specific lemmings that allow the selected lemming to alter the landscape, to affect the behavior of other lemmings, or to clear obstacles in order to create a safe passage for the rest of the lemmings.Lemmings was one of the best-received video games of the early 1990s era. The popularity of the game led to development of its numerous ports to other systems and the creation of several sequels, remakes and spin-offs, as well as inspiring similar games.Lemmings is divided into a number of levels, grouped into four difficulty categories. Each level includes some or all of the following elements: entrance and exit points (at least one of each per level), destructible landscape elements such as rocks or soil, indestructible elements such as steel plates, and obstacles including chasms, high walls, large drops, pools of water/acid/lava, and booby traps.While the player is able to paws (wordplay in the game) the game to inspect the level and status of the lemmings, skills can only be assigned in real-time. Lemmings are initially released at a rate predetermined by the level (from 1 to 99). The player can increase the rate as desired to a maximum of 99, and later decrease it down to, but not lower than, the initial rate. The player also has the option to \"nuke\" all the remaining lemmings on the screen, converting them to Bombers. This option can be used to abort a level when in a no-win situation, remove any Blockers that remain after the remaining lemmings have been rescued, or end a level quickly once the required percentage of saved lemmings has been reached.[2]The levels in Lemmings can be divided into three archetypes:The original Lemmings also has 20 two-player levels. This took advantage of the Amiga's ability to support two mice simultaneously, and the Atari's ability to support a mouse and a joystick simultaneously.[6] Each player is presented with their own view of the same map (on a vertically split screen), can only give orders to their own lemmings (green or blue), and had their own base. The goal is to get more lemmings (regardless of colour) into one's own base than the other player. Gameplay cycles through the 20 levels until neither player gets any lemmings home.[2]The Atari ST also has a two-player mode, one player using the keyboard or the joystick, and the other using the mouse. Two-player levels are also present in the Sega Mega Drive and Super NES versions, along with some levels unique to those versions and produced by their developer Sunsoft (some of these levels were also found in Oh No! More Lemmings with other designs). The multiplayer aspect of Lemmings has been incorporated into the variant Clones which can support up to 16 networked players at once.Mike Dailly, the first employee[7] of DMA Design and one of the programmers for Lemmings, has provided a detailed history of the development of Lemmings entitled \"The Lemmings Story\".[6] Dave Jones, founder of DMA Design, also has commented on the development and success of Lemmings.[8]Music was originally created by Brian Johnston (Scott's younger brother), who sampled bits of copyrighted music. This had been common practice, but at that point there was a growing awareness of music copyright. Psygnosis asked Tim Wright to replace the offending tracks, who often used arrangements and reworkings of classical and traditional music to avoid copyright problems.[6][9] Music tracks in the game include: \"Galop Infernal\" from Orpheus in the Underworld (the music by Offenbach often used for the can-can), \"Rondo alla Turca\" from Mozart's Piano Sonata No. 11, \"Dance of the Reed Flutes\" from Tchaikovsky's Nutcracker Suite, \"Dance of the Little Swans\" from Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake, \"Ten Lemmings\" (a track that uses melodies from traditional song \"Ten Green Bottles\"), Chopin's Piano Sonata No. 2 (the part used as funeral march), Wagner's \"Bridal Chorus\" (popularly known as \"Here Comes the Bride\"), \"London Bridge is Falling Down\", the English folk tune \"Forest Green\" (adapted into the hymn \"All Beautiful the March of Days\"), the carol \"O Little Town of Bethlehem\" mixed with the melody from the film The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, \"She'll Be Coming 'Round the Mountain\" and \"(How Much Is) That Doggie in the Window?\" (\"Doggie\" and \"Forest Green\" have been removed from some versions due to copyright issues with the owners.)In early 2006, Sony released a remake of Lemmings for the PlayStation Portable (PSP) handheld console, developed by Team17. It features all 120 levels from the original game, 36 brand new levels as well as DataPack support (similar to the Extra Track system featured in Wipeout Pure), and a user level editor. Every level in the game is a pre-rendered 3D landscape, although their gameplay is still 2D and remains faithful to the original game. User levels can be constructed from pre-rendered objects and distributed by uploading them to a PlayStation-specific Lemmings online community.[11][12] The soundtrack also marks the final video game score created by longtime composer Tim Follin after he announced his retirement from the industry in mid-2005.[13] The game was also ported by Rusty Nutz for play on the PlayStation 2 with use of the EyeToy in October 2006. The basic change in the concept is that the player must stretch and use his/her limbs in the recorded picture to aid the lemmings.[14] In 2007, Team17 produced a similar remake of Lemmings for the Sony PlayStation 3 for download through the PlayStation Network. The game has the similar graphical improvements as the PSP title, as well as on-line scoreboards and additional levels developed for high-definition display, but lacks the ability to create and share levels as the PSP version offers.[15]The original sales for Lemmings on the Amiga topped 55,000 copies on the first day of sales; in comparison, Menace sold 20,000 copies and Blood Money sold 40,000 copies cumulatively. With all the ports included, it has been estimated that over 15 million copies of Lemmings have been sold between 1991 and 2006.[32]Several gaming magazines of the time of its first releases gave Lemmings very high scores, with only the level of graphics and sound receiving some small amount of criticism.[33] David Sears of Compute!, in his review of Lemmings for the PC, stated that \"perhaps Psygnosis has tapped into the human instinct for survival in formulating this perfect blend of puzzle, strategy, and action.\"[34] Amiga Computing stated that \"Lemmings is absolutely brilliant. Psygnosis have managed to produce a game that is not only totally original, but also features the kind of addicting gameplay that will keep the player coming back for more time and time again.\"[35] A review from the Australian Commodore and Amiga Review (ACAR) stated that \"above all, the concept is simple, and the game is a lot of fun.\"[36] Computer Gaming World stated that \"Not since Tetris has this reviewer been so addicted to, or completely fascinated with, a series of challenging puzzles ... follow the crowd and get Lemmings\".[37] In 1992 the magazine named it its Action Game of the Year.[38] In 1996, Next Generation declared it \"second only to Tetris, the most addictive game of all time.\"[31] In 2004, readers of Retro Gamer voted Lemmings as the 21st top retro game, with the editors calling it \"perhaps Psygnosis’ finest hour and a turning point in the puzzle genre.\"[39]Electronic Gaming Monthly complimented the Lynx version's large number of options and password feature, and remarked, \"Lemmings has always been a good strategy game, and the Lynx version continues the tradition.\"[19]Lemmings for the PSP was warmly received, with a 76/100 average rating at Metacritic.[40] According to the review by GameSpot, \"Lemmings is a game-design classic that is as compelling now in its newest iteration on the PlayStation Portable as it was 15 years ago.\"[5] Eurogamer complained that the game was the otherwise bare port of the game to yet another system.[3] The PS2 EyeToy version was also panned by critics, being nothing more than a straight port of the PSP game with the added difficulty of getting the motions correct for the EyeToy, and only received an averaged Metacritic score of 67/100.[41] The PSN version's inability to create levels or play competitively online resulted in the game receiving mediocre reviews, with an averaged Metacritic score of 59/100.[42]Lemmings has inspired a number of sequels, some which have modified the core gameplay but still involve the use of lemming skills to rescue lemmings:One of the first video game clones[46] of Lemmings was The Humans, released for the Amiga in 1992. General game concepts have been included in the open source Pingus, where the player is required to safely guide penguins across landscapes using a similar array of tools.[47] Other similar games include CLONES and Turtle Trench.In 2010, it was announced that Lemmings will be ported to the iOS operating system by Mobile 1UP.[48] On 29 June 2010, Mobile 1UP reported that Sony Computer Entertainment Europe had presented them with a cease-and-desist letter, forcing them to halt development of the port.[49] In April 2011, Mobile 1UP has released a re-worked version of the work done in 2010 with a prehistoric setting (new artwork, sfx, music, levels) under the name Caveman, available for the iOS and webOS platforms.[50]Lemmings has also been called a predecessor of the modern real-time strategy (RTS) video game genre. A 1991 Amiga Power article claimed that Lemmings \"was the first major game to introduce the 'indirect-control' concept,\" an element that is now common in many RTS games.[51] 1UP.com noted that \"the biggest difference is that instead of trying to outmaneuver another player's army, you're trying to outwit the level designers' cruel design sensibilities.\"[52] Lemmings '​ introduction of RTS elements has been noted by fantasy author Terry Pratchett; in his novel Interesting Times, an army of golems is controlled in a fashion reminiscent of the Lemmings user interface. When readers asked if this was deliberate, Pratchett responded: \"Merely because the red army can fight, dig, march and climb and is controlled by little icons? Can't imagine how anyone thought that... Not only did I wipe Lemmings from my hard disk, I overwrote it so's I couldn't get it back.\"[53]Yannick LeJacq of Kotaku, commenting on the 2014 Mousecraft which incorporates elements of Lemmings and Tetris, speculated that games like Lemmings would not be very successful against current games as the trial-and-error approach tied with waiting for the Lemmings to reach specific points creates gameplay that is far too slow to satisfy most players.[54]","title":"Lemmings","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/0c/Lemmings-BoxScan.jpg/250px-Lemmings-BoxScan.jpg","developer":"DMA Design","genre":"Puzzle"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemmings_2:_The_Tribes","description":"Lemmings 2: The Tribes, a computer game released in 1993, is the first real sequel to the popular puzzle game Lemmings.[1] As with the original, it was developed by DMA Design and published by Psygnosis.

This caused controversy as it allowed players to shoot photorealistic representations of enemies.Lethal Enforcers was followed by Lethal Enforcers II: Gun Fighters. Both games would later be released in the two-in-one compilation Lethal Enforcers I & II (Lethal Enforcers Deluxe Pack in Japan) for the PlayStation.Years later, Konami released the Police 911 series as a Japan-themed sequel to the original plot. This was also followed by the arcade game Seigi No Hero, which was localized and renamed as Lethal Enforcers 3 for Western audiences.Home versions were released for the Super NES, Sega Genesis/Mega Drive and Sega CD. The home versions make use of a revolver-shaped light gun known as the Konami Justifier, which came packaged with the game. A standard controller can be also used in lieu of the light gun in these versions. A second-player Justifier light gun, pink in color, was available only by mail order from Konami. The CD version features higher quality CD-DA music. The game is also featured alongside Lethal Enforcers II in the two-in-one compilation titled: Lethal Enforcers I & II (Lethal Enforcers Deluxe Pack in Japan), released for the PlayStation in 1997.Lethal Enforcers was one of the video games involved in the video game violence controversy of the early 1990s and at the time it was not sold in toy stores. Along with Night Trap, the Genesis version was one of the first video games to be rated MA-17 by Sega's Videogame Rating Council.[1]The Japanese arcade version of Lethal Enforcers contain several differences from the US and European arcade versions. These differences include the \"how to reload\" animation (the US and European versions show a woman shooting outside of the cabinet's screen to reload in-game, while the Japanese version shows the default revolver and how to reload it), and an additional enemy taunt, \"Die, pigs!\", which was removed from the US and European versions.A level in Konami's shooter Jikkyō Oshaberi Parodius is modeled after Lethal Enforcers and has the player character avoiding moving crosshairs.

Battles are resolved via fists, guns and grenades. It is considered by many[who?] to be extremely difficult and frustrating in the fact that punching an enemy is more effective than shooting an enemy. It has minimal music and sparse interesting scenery.[citation needed]There was another version of the game released for the day's home computer formats and the Super NES. It also is a difficult side-scroller where the user plays as either Riggs or Murtaugh and has to complete four missions in order to go on to the fifth and final mission. There is little difference between the two characters, other than Riggs having a faster rate of fire for his handgun, but at the cost of having a low jump height, while Murtaugh has a higher jump height at the cost of a low rate of fire for his handgun. The first four missions have the player trying to do things such as rescue Leo Getz, defuse a bomb in a shopping mall, stop a dockside smuggling operation, and prevent terrorists from blowing up the city's sewer system.

Liberty or Death is part of Koei's Historical Simulation Series.An interesting facet of Liberty or Death is that there are also Patriot and Loyalist militia regiments and German mercenary regiments, organized and paid for by the Americans and British, respectively, which will fight and collect resources on their own, unless they are recruited. These groups will continue to run the districts they are in and can attack and annex adjacent districts if they choose to. If a regular commander for their side moves into the district, these militia units will place themselves under his authority if he is of equal or higher rank, swelling his ranks.Liberty or Death represents a great many historical figures associated with the Revolution, including political leaders like Lord North, William Pitt the Younger, Patrick Henry (whose famous speech gives the game its name) and John Adams.Reviewing the Super NES version, GamePro praised the historical accuracy but were reluctant to recommend the game due to the excessive minutia of the gameplay, concluding, \"Despite the more familiar history, Liberty or Death is still probably foreign fare for most gamers.

Set in the American Old West, it stars the titular character, Lucky Luke, the cowboy known to \"shoot faster than his shadow\". His name is inspired by that of Luciano Locarno, an Italian American sheriff who lived between 1860 and 1940.Along with The Adventures of Tintin, Johan and Peewit, The Smurfs and Asterix, Lucky Luke is one of the most popular and best-selling comic-book series in continental Europe.[2] About half of the series' adventures have been translated into English. Lucky Luke comics have been translated into 23 languages, including many European languages, some African and Asian languages.Both a tribute to the mythic Old West and an affectionate parody, the comics were created by the Belgian artist Morris who drew Lucky Luke from 1946 until his death in 2001. The first Lucky Luke adventure named Arizona 1880 appeared in the Almanach issue of the Franco-Belgian comics magazine Spirou on December 7, 1946.[3] After several years of solitary work on the strip, Morris began a collaboration with René Goscinny who became the series' writer for a period that is considered the golden age of the series. This started with the story Des rails sur la Prairie published on August 25, 1955 in Spirou.[4] Ending a long run of serial publications in Spirou, the series shifted to Goscinny's Pilote magazine in 1967 with the story La Diligence, subsequently leaving publisher Dupuis for Dargaud.After the death of Goscinny in 1977, several writers have tried to fill the role of storyteller, including Vicq, Bob de Groot, Jean Léturgie and Lo Hartog Van Banda. In addition to continuing the series, Morris started the related spin-off series Rantanplan in 1987. At the 1993 Angoulême International Comics Festival, Lucky Luke was given an honorary exhibition.[5]After Morris' death in 2001, French artist Achdé continued drawing new Lucky Luke stories in collaboration with writer Laurent Gerra.Lucky Luke comics have been translated into Afrikaans, Arabic, Bengali, Bosnian, Catalan, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Estonian, Finnish, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hungarian, Icelandic, Indonesian, Italian, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese (both in the Brazilian and Portuguese forms), Serbian, Slovene, Spanish, Swedish, Tamil, Turkish, Vietnamese and Welsh.Although always described as a cowboy, Luke generally acts as a righter of wrongs or bodyguard of some sort, where he excels thanks to his resourcefulness and incredible gun prowess. A recurring task is that of capturing bumbling gangsters the Dalton brothers, Joe, William, Jack and Averell. He rides Jolly Jumper, \"the smartest horse in the world\" and is often accompanied by Rantanplan, \"the stupidest dog in the universe\", a spoof of Rin Tin Tin.Luke meets many historical Western figures like Calamity Jane, Billy the Kid, Judge Roy Bean and Jesse James's gang, and takes part in events such as the guarding of Wells Fargo stagecoaches, the Pony Express, the building of the First Transcontinental Telegraph, the Rush into the Unassigned Lands of Oklahoma, and a tour by French actress Sarah Bernhardt. Some of the books feature a one-page article on the background to the events featured. Goscinny once said that he and Morris tried to base the Lucky Luke adventures on real events whenever possible, but that they would not let the facts get in the way of a funny story.The chronology of the albums is deliberately murky, and in most albums no particular year is given. The villains and incidental characters based on real persons lived over most of the mid-to-late-19th century. For example, in the album Daily Star, Lucky Luke meets a young Horace Greeley, prior to his moving to New York. Although no year is mentioned in the album, this story must take place c. 1830, since the real Horace Greeley moved to New York in 1831. Judge Roy Bean, who was appointed judge in 1882, appears in another album, taking place some fifty years later – and in another album, Lucky Luke takes part in the 1892 Coffeyville shootout against the Dalton Gang. Lucky Luke himself appears unchanged in all stories.Except at the very beginning of the saga, Luke is never seen to kill anyone, preferring to disarm people by shooting weapons out of their hands.At the end of each story, except the earliest, Lucky Luke rides off alone into the sunset on Jolly Jumper, singing (in English) \"I'm a poor lonesome cowboy, and a long way from home...\".\"Lucky Luke's famous cigarette not only identifies a profile but allows the tempo to be modified and extended, expressing a feeling: in Le Pied-tendre (The Tenderfoot), Morris shows Lucky Luke's feelings at the death of a friend in a series of three frames in which the hero rolls and spills a cigarette.\"[6]Morris, who has been criticized over Lucky Luke's cigarette for a long time, answered his critics  : \"the cigarette is part of the character's profile, just like the pipe of Popeye or Maigret\".[7] It is claimed that Morris was forced to remove cigarettes Lucky Luke smokes from his strip and Lucky Luke who \"used to be a heavy smoker\", had to give up smoking for \"commercial reasons\", \"apparently to gain access to the American market\".[6][8][9] On World No Tobacco Day in 1989, the magazine Spirou published a militantly anti-tobacco issue, #2668.[6][10] Morris won an award from the World Health Organization in 1988 when he replaced Luke's omnipresent cigarette with a wisp of straw (in the story \"Fingers\") in 1983, \"an anti-cigarette poster today proclaims \"Even Lucky Luke can't stand them!\" and shows the happy cowboy in a radical reversal of his image\".[6][11][12] In the 2007 animated film \"Tous à l'Ouest: Une aventure de Lucky Luke\", Lucky Luke is seen using what appears to be a nicotine patch and mentions that before that he had to \"chew on a piece of straw for a while\" right after he quit smoking. In the story \"The bridge over the Mississippi\", he is seen rolling a cigarette again, although he claims it was just to hide his boredom.Some of the humour in Lucky Luke is based on clichés and stereotypes, including many ethnic stereotypes of \"sneaky\" Chinese or \"lazy\" Mexicans,[13] Native Americans, Irish and Italians[9] as well as \"darky\" depictions of Afro-Americans. According to the Forbidden Planet correspondent: \"They played on the clichés of the genre, with humour that nowadays probably would be considered quite racist (lazy Mexicans, sneaky Chinese), but also with a special sort of satire, mirroring contemporary social platitudes.\" [13] Luke himself however, treats everyone with respect and protects any (stereotype-or-not) vulnerable person against injustice.Apart from the collections mentioned below, Lucky Luke comics were published in British comic book magazines such as Film Fun Comic or Giggle (in 1967). The Giggle version had Luke's name changed to \"Buck Bingo\".[14]Brockhampton Press Ltd, Leicester, began publishing the books in hardcover and softcover, with six titles from 1972 to 1974, translated by Frederick W Nolan. Brockhampton became part of Hodder & Stoughton Ltd in 1976, and under their children's imprint, Knight Books, Hodder published mini-sized paperback editions of the first six books, in 1976 to 1977. In 1980 and 1982, Hodder & Stoughton published three new titles as Hodder Dargaud, as well as reprints of the previous six.Cinebook Ltd have been publishing English language translations of Lucky Luke since 2006. One new volume is released every two months. In India only, Euro Books, a division of Euro Kids International Ltd. published English versions of 24 Lucky Luke titles in 2009.Brockhampton Press (UK)Knight Books (UK)Hodder Dargaud (UK)Dargaud USA and CanadaFantasy Flight (US)Ravette Books (UK)Glo'worm (UK)Cinebook LtdEurokids (India)Four theatrical animated films were created. In 1990, Disney released one of them, The Ballad of the Daltons, on VHS. Three of the movies were part of a trilogy. The first of the films was titled Daisy Town (1971), followed by La Ballade des Dalton (1978) and finished by Les Dalton en cavale (1983), meaning The Daltons on the Loose in English.In addition to the theatrical animated movies, there was also an animated Lucky Luke television series:Xilam produced a theatrical animated film (the fourth film), Tous à l'Ouest: Une aventure de Lucky Luke (Go West: A Lucky Luke Adventure), which was released in France on December 5, 2007.[15]In 1991, two live-action films (Lucky Luke and Lucky Luke 2) and in 1992 a live-action television series (The Adventures of Lucky Luke) starring Terence Hill as Lucky Luke were produced.In 2004, the film Les Dalton featured Til Schweiger as Lucky Luke.In 2009, Yves Marmion and UGC (the producers of Les Dalton) produced the film Lucky Luke starring French actor Jean Dujardin as the gunslinger. The film was released on October 21, 2009 in Europe.Over the years, several Lucky Luke video games were released for many platforms, most of them by Infogrames,[16] and only released in Europe (the only ones released for the North American market were the Game Boy Color and PlayStation versions).A Lucky Luke game was also developed for mobile phones by The Mighty Troglodytes.[citation needed] Lucky Luke: Go West was released in Europe for the PC, Nintendo Wii and Nintendo DS in the end of 2007.In 2013, French publishers Dupuis and Anuman Interactive announced the development of a new Time Management game: Lucky Luke: Transcontinental Railroad, on PC, Mac, iOS and Android.[17]","title":"","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/0e/LuckyLuke2.png","developer":"","genre":""},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lufia_%26_the_Fortress_of_Doom","description":"Lufia & the Fortress of Doom, known as Estpolis Denki (エストポリス伝記?, officially translated Biography of Estpolis[1]) in Japan, is a role-playing video game developed by Neverland and published by Taito in 1993, for the Super Nintendo. It is the first title in the Lufia series of video games and the only game from the series released under the Taito label in North America.The story of Lufia & the Fortress of Doom begins, in accordance with an ancient prophecy of the Lufia world, with a massive floating island with a large castle located on it emerging into the sky one dark day. Dubbed the \"Fortress of Doom\", this castle served as the base of operations for a group of all-powerful beings known as the Sinistrals, who planned to use their strength to bring the world to its knees.Lufia & the Fortress of Doom plays much like a traditional role-playing video game and features 2D character sprites and environments. The player advances the story by travelling through several harsh dungeons, encountering monsters along the way. These battles occur randomly (every few steps or so) or in scripted situations, and winning them yields experience points that go towards leveling up the characters, giving them access to new abilities and making them stronger in the process. The battles themselves take place from a first-person perspective, and require the player to use each character's strengths, such as physical attacks or magic use, as in many other mainstream RPGs.Taito developed a port of Lufia & the Fortress of Doom for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis, but the game, primarily intended for a North American release, was not released because of Taito America's closure in 1995.[1] At least two full-page advertisements were made in US magazines, the second one announcing a delay to spring 1995, with the tagline \"It´s worth the wait\".","title":"Lufia & the Fortress of Doom","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/36/Lufia_Fortress_of_Doom.jpg/220px-Lufia_Fortress_of_Doom.jpg","developer":"Neverland","genre":"Role-playing game"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lufia_II:_Rise_of_the_Sinistrals","description":"Lufia II: Rise of the Sinistrals, known as Estpolis Denki II (エストポリス伝記II?, officially translated Biography of Estpolis II[1]) in Japan, and as simply Lufia in Europe and Australia, is a role-playing video game game with puzzle elements developed by Neverland and published in Japan in 1995 by Taito, and in North America and Europe in 1996 by Natsume and Nintendo respectively, for the Super Nintendo video game console.","title":"Lufia II: Rise of the Sinistrals","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f6/Lufia_II.jpg","developer":"Neverland","genre":"Role-playing game"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=M.A.C.S._Basic_Rifle_Marksmanship&action=edit&redlink=1","description":"Other reasons this message may be displayed:\n","title":"","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b4/Wiktionary-logo-en.png/28px-Wiktionary-logo-en.png","developer":"","genre":""},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madden_NFL_%2794","description":"","title":"Madden NFL '94","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/25/Madden_NFL_%2794_Coverart.png","developer":"Tiburon Entertainment","genre":"Sports"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madden_NFL_%2795","description":"","title":"Madden NFL '95","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/d1/Madden_NFL_%2795_Coverart.png/250px-Madden_NFL_%2795_Coverart.png","developer":"Visual Concepts","genre":"Sports"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madden_NFL_%2796","description":"","title":"Madden NFL '96","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/fe/Madden_NFL_%2796_Coverart.png","developer":"Tiburon Entertainment","genre":"Sports"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madden_NFL_97","description":"Madden NFL 97 is the first Madden NFL football game to be created in the 32-bit gaming era.

In six different levels and with four different special power outfits it features Mickey Mouse on his journey to find his dog Pluto.[7] The game, and especially its outfit system and graphics, received mostly positive reviews. It was criticized, however, for being relatively short. A port for Sega Mega Drive was originally planned, but was abandoned.[8]Mickey Mouse can wear four different types of outfits in The Magical Quest Starring Mickey Mouse. Some outfits can be upgraded in the general stores found scattered throughout the game.The Super NES version of The Magical Quest Starring Mickey Mouse was generally well received by critics. Most reviewers praised the details and colorfulness of the graphics and the animations in the game, some reviewers even calling it some of the best graphics on the system to date. Especially the bosses and backgrounds were noted for their graphical appearance. The outfit system was also well received and many critics thought it added depth to the gameplay. Sound and music received mixed to positive ratings, as some thought the music loops were too short and that the sound wasn't up to par with the rest of the game, while some found the music and sound effects very suitable to a Disney cartoon game. A great deal of the criticism was geared towards the difficulty of the game. Many reviewers believed that the game was too easy and/or short, mainly due to the game's unlimited continue system that allowed the player to replay a game level until finished, leading to them recommending the game only for younger children.

Nintendo had little involvement in the development of these games; they were created by various other developers, including The Software Toolworks and Interplay Entertainment. Some of the titles were released exclusively for either the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), the Super NES, or for personal computers, while others were released on two or more of those platforms. The Mario educational games were generally designed for use by children in preschool or kindergarten and focused on developing skills ranging from language and typing to geography and history. The educational games were not well-received, with many critics and gamers labeling them as some of the worst Mario games ever made.[1] Many of them have spawned Internet memes.I Am a Teacher: Super Mario Sweater (アイアムアティーチャースーパーマリオのセーター, Ai amu a Tīchā: Sūpā Mario no Sētā?) is a Famicom Disk System game released in 1988 only in Japan. It was designed by Royal Industries Co., Ltd., a Japanese appliance and sewing machine company. Using the program, players could design the sweater they want and the company would make it for 2900 yen (~$24).The \"Mario Discovery Series\" is a label given to five Mario educational games that were developed by The Software Toolworks.[2]Mario is Missing! is a geography-based game for the PC, Macintosh, Super NES and NES. It was developed by The Software Toolworks and released in 1992 for PC and SNES. In 1993, the NES version was made and developed by Radical Entertainment. The first two versions were published by Mindscape, and the NES version was published by Nintendo. It features very similar sprites to those of Super Mario World (SNES) and Super Mario Bros. 3 (NES).Mario Is Missing! is the first Mario game to feature only Luigi as the starring character, which did not occur again until Luigi's Mansion in 2001.Bowser sets up a castle in Antarctica, and plans to use many hair dryers from Hafta Havit, a mail order company, to melt Antarctica's ice and flood Earth. He sends Koopas to cities across Earth to steal artifacts to fund his operation. Mario, Luigi and Yoshi travel to Bowser's castle to stop him. Luigi is hesitant to go in, so Mario goes by himself and is kidnapped by Bowser, prompting Luigi to rescue him. This plot is not explicitly included in the Super Nintendo version.Luigi progresses through the game by completing levels in Bowser's castle; each floor is guarded by one Koopaling and contains a number of pipes which transport Luigi to a city containing Koopas. Once a floor is completed, Luigi must defeat the Koopaling guarding that floor to proceed to the next.The main gameplay consists of moving around a city in side-scrolling manner while jumping on Koopas to collect stolen artifacts (pieces of famous landmarks).[3] Luigi then must \"secure\" the city by taking these artifacts to their respective locations and correctly answering two questions about the landmark. Once an artifact is returned, the landmark is reopened. During the quest to return all three artifacts to their proper landmarks, Luigi must determine his location to receive the assistance of Yoshi by using a device called the Globulator. If Luigi takes Yoshi to the correct location, he can ride him for double the walking and running speed. Once the exit pipe is found, Luigi is returned to the castle as long as he has Yoshi with him to scare the Pokey into the pipe; otherwise he will be unable to return to the castle. He can then proceed to another town to do it again.In each city, Luigi is able to question the locals to gain clues as to his current location, the general direction of remaining Koopas, and information about the affected landmarks. He is given a map showing where information booths, people and Koopas are in the city. After returning the artifacts to the locations, Luigi takes photographs of the places he visits, which can be viewed any time later in the game.The game has a difficulty level ranging from preschool all the way up to \"adult\" (i.e. college) difficulty.The Mario's Early Years! games were released for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. The three games were Mario's Early Years! Fun with Letters; Mario's Early Years! Fun with Numbers; and Mario's Early Years! Preschool Fun (known in the United Kingdom as Mario's Playschool[citation needed]). The games were released in September, October, and November 1994, respectively, and all support the SNES Mouse peripheral. The games contain Mario, Princess Peach and Yoshi on a wooden boat traveling from island to island, learning about various subjects. All three games use the same game engine.Fun with Numbers and Fun with Letters were both directed by Andy Iverson and Henrik Markarian, and Preschool Fun was directed by Peter Lipson. While the games feature some remixes of Super Mario World music, original music was composed by Rob Wallace and Sam Powell.Nintendo Power awarded Fun with Letters a score of 2.95 out of 5[4] and Preschool Fun a score of 2.725 out of 5.[5]Mario Teaches Typing was released on personal computers and was designed to teach typing skills to children. The game was developed by Interplay and published by Nintendo. It was first released for MS-DOS in 1991 and then for Microsoft Windows and Macintosh in 1995. Mario is voiced by Ronald B. Ruben in the floppy disk version and by Charles Martinet in the CD-ROM version. A sequel, Mario Teaches Typing 2, was developed by Interplay and published by Nintendo in 1996. Mario is voiced only by Martinet in the sequel.Mario Teaches Typing includes three selectable characters: Mario, Luigi and Princess Peach. The game displays two pairs of hands which show which finger to use; for example, if the player has to type \"A\", the leftmost finger is highlighted. If the player makes an error, the cursor does not advance until they enter the correct key. After time ends, the exercise ends and a chalkboard screen appears, displaying statistics on how well the player performed, including words per minute. Mario Teaches Typing 2 adds additional gameplay features, including a customizable certificate of achievement, color-coded on-screen keyboard, customizable lesson plans, and the infamous Mario head.Unlike the first game, Mario Teaches Typing 2 features a story in which Mario and Luigi encounter a magical typewriter. After Mario incorrectly types a phrase that would destroy Bowser's castle, the typewriter explodes into three pieces. The pieces of the typewriter are retrieved as the player progresses through the game lessons; when the typewriter is fully repaired Mario is able to type the phrase correctly, resulting in the destruction of Bowser's castle.Super Mario Bros. & Friends: When I Grow Up is a children's computer coloring game, featuring Mario and Luigi, released in 1991 for the PC. Players can paint Mario and other Nintendo characters.","title":"","developer":"","genre":""},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Paint","description":"Mario Paint (Japanese: マリオペイント, Hepburn: Mario Peinto?) is a video game released in 1992 by Nintendo for use with the Super Famicom/SNES. It is packaged with the Super Famicom/SNES Mouse peripheral device and mouse pad.Aside from being a basic drawing utility, Mario Paint allows the user to make custom stamps pixel-by-pixel. Several publications, such as Nintendo Power, released guides on how to create iconic Nintendo related stamps for use within Mario Paint. In addition to just creating static pictures, a user can make simple looping animations which can then be set to music created in the music generator. These animations painted by the user can only be viewed on a television screen, and while instructions were provided to users on how to record these to a video cassette recorder, there is no other way to export any of the work done in Mario Paint.Mario Paint contains a fly-swatting mini-game, Gnat Attack, which is a fast-paced action game that takes full advantage of the Super Famicom/SNES mouse. The player controls a gloved hand (similar to the one seen on the title screen) holding a flyswatter, which must swat flying insects on the screen, before the insect stings the player's hand in one way or another. There are three levels, each with 100 insects and a boss. When you win the last boss it takes you back to level one and adds a small icon in the top left corner of the screen. There is no final level or reward, as the game will loop endlessly.The title screen for Mario Paint is a mini-game of sorts. The user is able to click each letter in the title to trigger a certain action. Certain letters cause the music to change, have Yoshi run by on screen, make Mario shrink and grow, allow the user to temporarily paint the background, and other features.Calling Mario Paint \"perhaps the most ingenious and inspired idea Nintendo ever came up with for a product\", AllGame rated it 5 out of 5 stars.[3] In 2006, it was rated the 162nd best game made on a Nintendo system in Nintendo Power's Top 200 Games list.[4] In 2014, IGN ranked it as the 105th best Nintendo game in their list \"The top 125 Nintendo Games of All Time\". IGN editor Peer Schneider cited the game's \"smart and playful interface\" as a \"game changer\" and commented that \"It effectively erased the barriers between creating and playing, making it one of the most memorable and unique games to ever be released on a console.\"[5]\"Kazumi Totaka's Song\" is a 19-note song that appears in many Nintendo games. In Mario Paint, the song is an Easter egg, found on the front screen when a user clicks the \"O\" in the word \"Mario Paint\".[6] Its first appearance was in a Japanese-only Game Boy game, X.The first episode of Homestar Runner was animated using Mario Paint.[7] A primitive introduction video made with Mario Paint can be found in the museum of the site. A later short in the series, Strong Bad is a Bad Guy, was made using Mario Paint.Prominent video game developers have cited Mario Paint as an inspiration. Masahito Hatakeyama, one of the designers for WarioWare D.I.Y., cites Mario Paint '​s drawing and music creation tools as inspiration for the drawing and music creation tools in D.I.Y., while several staff members of the development team cited it as the game that taught them the joy of developing video games.[8] WarioWare D.I.Y. allows players to record notes via the DS microphone, and apply noises and animals sounds to them, similar to Mario Paint's music creation. WarioWare D.I.Y. uses a paint program similar to Mario Paint when the player makes a comic or graphics for their custom microgame. When \"Mario Paint\" is entered as the name for a microgame or comic, the Mario Paint theme will play. Some of Mario Paint '​s sound effects and musical instruments appear in this game.One of the sound staff from Mario Paint, Hirokazu Tanaka, later worked on EarthBound. Some of Mario Paint '​s sound effects and musical instruments appear in this game.In 1997, a followup titled BS Mario Paint: Yuu Shou Naizou Ban was released to Japanese markets via Satellaview broadcast. This version was modified such that the Super Famicom Mouse peripheral is no longer required.While no official sequel has been released in North America, Mario Paint makes a cameo appearance in WarioWare: Touched! as \"Wario Paint,\" allowing the player to use the stylus to color various characters in the game. \"Totaka's Song\" can be played with the toy Turntable in the Toy Room. The fly-swatting game makes an additional appearance in the preceding game, WarioWare, Inc.: Mega Microgame$. The Wii Photo Channel features editing functionality similar to Mario Paint, and even includes several of the special erasers.Takashi Tezuka, designer of Mario Maker for Wii U, stated that he \"was inspired to bring the fun of Mario Paint into this course editor to make something fun and creative for people to enjoy\".[9]","title":"Mario Paint","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/ea/Mario_paint_box.jpg/250px-Mario_paint_box.jpg","developer":"Nintendo R&D1","genre":"Art tool"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario%27s_Early_Years!_Fun_with_Letters","description":"The popularity of the Super Mario series led to the release of several spin-off Mario educational games from 1988 to 1996.

Using the program, players could design the sweater they want and the company would make it for 2900 yen (~$24).The \"Mario Discovery Series\" is a label given to five Mario educational games that were developed by The Software Toolworks.[2]Mario is Missing! is a geography-based game for the PC, Macintosh, Super NES and NES. It was developed by The Software Toolworks and released in 1992 for PC and SNES. In 1993, the NES version was made and developed by Radical Entertainment. The first two versions were published by Mindscape, and the NES version was published by Nintendo. It features very similar sprites to those of Super Mario World (SNES) and Super Mario Bros. 3 (NES).Mario Is Missing! is the first Mario game to feature only Luigi as the starring character, which did not occur again until Luigi's Mansion in 2001.Bowser sets up a castle in Antarctica, and plans to use many hair dryers from Hafta Havit, a mail order company, to melt Antarctica's ice and flood Earth. He sends Koopas to cities across Earth to steal artifacts to fund his operation. Mario, Luigi and Yoshi travel to Bowser's castle to stop him. Luigi is hesitant to go in, so Mario goes by himself and is kidnapped by Bowser, prompting Luigi to rescue him. This plot is not explicitly included in the Super Nintendo version.Luigi progresses through the game by completing levels in Bowser's castle; each floor is guarded by one Koopaling and contains a number of pipes which transport Luigi to a city containing Koopas. Once a floor is completed, Luigi must defeat the Koopaling guarding that floor to proceed to the next.The main gameplay consists of moving around a city in side-scrolling manner while jumping on Koopas to collect stolen artifacts (pieces of famous landmarks).[3] Luigi then must \"secure\" the city by taking these artifacts to their respective locations and correctly answering two questions about the landmark. Once an artifact is returned, the landmark is reopened. During the quest to return all three artifacts to their proper landmarks, Luigi must determine his location to receive the assistance of Yoshi by using a device called the Globulator. If Luigi takes Yoshi to the correct location, he can ride him for double the walking and running speed. Once the exit pipe is found, Luigi is returned to the castle as long as he has Yoshi with him to scare the Pokey into the pipe; otherwise he will be unable to return to the castle. He can then proceed to another town to do it again.In each city, Luigi is able to question the locals to gain clues as to his current location, the general direction of remaining Koopas, and information about the affected landmarks. He is given a map showing where information booths, people and Koopas are in the city. After returning the artifacts to the locations, Luigi takes photographs of the places he visits, which can be viewed any time later in the game.The game has a difficulty level ranging from preschool all the way up to \"adult\" (i.e. college) difficulty.The Mario's Early Years! games were released for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. The three games were Mario's Early Years! Fun with Letters; Mario's Early Years! Fun with Numbers; and Mario's Early Years! Preschool Fun (known in the United Kingdom as Mario's Playschool[citation needed]). The games were released in September, October, and November 1994, respectively, and all support the SNES Mouse peripheral. The games contain Mario, Princess Peach and Yoshi on a wooden boat traveling from island to island, learning about various subjects. All three games use the same game engine.Fun with Numbers and Fun with Letters were both directed by Andy Iverson and Henrik Markarian, and Preschool Fun was directed by Peter Lipson. While the games feature some remixes of Super Mario World music, original music was composed by Rob Wallace and Sam Powell.Nintendo Power awarded Fun with Letters a score of 2.95 out of 5[4] and Preschool Fun a score of 2.725 out of 5.[5]Mario Teaches Typing was released on personal computers and was designed to teach typing skills to children.

Mario is voiced only by Martinet in the sequel.Mario Teaches Typing includes three selectable characters: Mario, Luigi and Princess Peach. The game displays two pairs of hands which show which finger to use; for example, if the player has to type \"A\", the leftmost finger is highlighted. If the player makes an error, the cursor does not advance until they enter the correct key. After time ends, the exercise ends and a chalkboard screen appears, displaying statistics on how well the player performed, including words per minute. Mario Teaches Typing 2 adds additional gameplay features, including a customizable certificate of achievement, color-coded on-screen keyboard, customizable lesson plans, and the infamous Mario head.Unlike the first game, Mario Teaches Typing 2 features a story in which Mario and Luigi encounter a magical typewriter. After Mario incorrectly types a phrase that would destroy Bowser's castle, the typewriter explodes into three pieces. The pieces of the typewriter are retrieved as the player progresses through the game lessons; when the typewriter is fully repaired Mario is able to type the phrase correctly, resulting in the destruction of Bowser's castle.Super Mario Bros. & Friends: When I Grow Up is a children's computer coloring game, featuring Mario and Luigi, released in 1991 for the PC.

The film, in turn, was loosely based on the Dark Horse comic book series of the same name.[3]If the player runs out of health, then he returns to being Ipkiss, wearing his pajamas. Many of The Mask's moves featured in the game were based on scenes in the movie, such as the mallet (which he uses to smash the alarm clock in the movie), the tornado, the massive guns he pulls from his pocket during the final confrontation during the movie, and the huge \"living\" horn.[3] It also features other moves, such as a sneaking move which makes The Mask invisible (his enemies do not see him), a dash move (as well as a \"superdash\" move where he runs at supersonic speed), and his primary attack which is a basic punch move with cartoon boxing gloves. Many of the special moves (the mallet, guns, horn, etc.) use The Mask's \"Morph\" power, which is replenished with power-ups. If his morph meter runs out it slowly replenishes to a smaller amount than that he started out with, much like the ammo replenishes for the main gun in Earthworm Jim.The beta version of The Mask played more like a beat 'em up rather than a side-scrolling action game. Damage in the beta version came in a series of expressions; similar to the various faces used in the 1993 first-person shooter Doom. Different backgrounds were placed in the incomplete version that were scrapped in the retail version. Violent-looking attacks like a projectile-firing gun and a karate-style low kick were deleted from the final version.[8]Electronic Gaming Monthly gave The Mask a score of 6.8 out of 10 (equivalent to a C+ letter grade). GamePro gave this video game a score of 3.5 out of 5. Allgame gave it a score of 3 out of 5. Game Players gave the game a score of 82%.

(ロックマン7 宿命の対決!, Rokkuman Sebun Shukumei no Taiketsu!?, lit. \"Rockman 7: Showdown of Destiny!\") in Japan, is a video game developed by Capcom for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. It is the seventh game in the original Mega Man series and the first and only title in the main series to be featured on the 16-bit console. The video game was first released in Japan on March 24, 1995 and was localized later in the year in North America and Europe. The game is also available for the PlayStation 2, Nintendo GameCube, and Xbox as part of the Mega Man Anniversary Collection. It is also known for the information that is given to the player in the Shade Man stage. Mega Man 7 was created to revitalize the original franchise after the release of Mega Man X, which got very positive reviews. However, it scored lower ratings than Mega Man X, and was seen as an inferior game to Mega Man X by fans.Picking up directly after the events of Mega Man 6, the plot involves the protagonist Mega Man once again attempting to stop the evil Dr. Wily, who uses a new set of Robot Masters to free himself from captivity and begin wreaking havoc on the world. Along with some help from his old friends, Mega Man finds potential allies in the mysterious robot pair Bass and Treble, who are later revealed to be in league with Wily. In terms of gameplay, Mega Man 7 follows that same classic action and platforming introduced in the 8-bit Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) titles, but updates the graphics and sound of the series for the more powerful SNES.According to its creators, Mega Man 7 was only in development for a short time before its release. Keiji Inafune, a noted character designer and illustrator for the franchise, handed off his duties to Hayato Kaji for this installment. Mega Man 7 has received an overall average critical reception. Although many considered it a competent game by itself, a majority of reviewers either called it a simple rehash of previous entries in the Mega Man saga, or considered it inferior to the inventive spin-off Mega Man X, released on the SNES over a year earlier.Taking place in the 21st century (the ambiguous year 20XX), Mega Man 7 begins directly after the events of Mega Man 6. Thanks to the efforts of Mega Man and his friends, Dr. Wily was finally brought to justice. However, Wily had always known that he might be imprisoned one day, and so he had constructed four backup Robot Masters in a hidden laboratory, Burst Man, Cloud Man, Junk Man, and Freeze Man. If they did not receive any communication for six months, they would activate and begin searching for their master. After six months, the robots activate, round up an army, and go on a rampage throughout the city in which Dr. Wily is being held. Mega Man is called into action. Upon driving into the city with Roll and Auto, he sees that it is in ruins, and that he is too late to stop Wily's Robot Masters from liberating the evil scientist. Mega Man gives chase, but is stopped by Bass, a robot with capabilities much like Mega Man's own, and his robotic wolf Treble. After a brief skirmish, Mega Man is informed that the two of them are battling Wily as well.[4] Bass and Treble then take off, leaving Mega Man confused, but convinced that he has new allies and determined to again stop Dr. Wily's plans.Gameplay in Mega Man 7 is mostly identical to the six previous games in the series. The player, as Mega Man, must complete a series of side-scrolling platform levels that typically end in a boss battle with a Robot Master.[8] Destroying the Robot Master earns the player its special Master Weapon, which can be selected and used in all future stages.[9][10] Each Robot Master is weak to a specific Master Weapon. Unlike the first six Mega Man games, only four new Robot Master stages are selectable at a time.[8] After the player completes the introductory level, the first four Robot Masters in the list (Freeze Man, Cloud Man, Burst Man, and Junk Man) are selectable. After these are beaten, the player is taken to the intermission Robot Museum stage. When this stage is beaten, the other four Robot Masters (Slash Man, Spring Man, Shade Man, and Turbo Man) become available.Mega Man 7 uses many of the same conventions introduced in previous installments, such as sliding along the ground, being able to charge the Mega Buster for more powerful shots, and calling on the hero's dog Rush to perform various tasks. One unique feature is Rush Search, which causes Rush to dig up useful items wherever the player is standing.[8][9] Certain stages contain the letters \"R-U-S-H\", which, when collected, will grant the player access to the \"Rush Super Adaptor\", a combination of the two enhancements introduced in Mega Man 6 with a powerful rocket-arm attack and jetpack for flying short distances.[6][10] Defeated enemies found throughout each stage can give the player extra lives, items which refill health and weapon power, and special bolts. The player can visit \"Eddie's Cybernetic Support Shop\" from the stage select screen, where these bolts can be spent on items and power-ups, a feature that originally debuted in the Game Boy Mega Man titles.[8][9][10][11] The use of bolts and the purchase of items at a part shop would become a standard for the core titles starting with Mega Man 7.[6][11] Other gameplay elements also exist, such as the player being able to obtain the robotic, helper bird Beat and Proto Man's trademark shield.[9][10]Prior to the release of Mega Man 7, numbered entries in the original Mega Man series were only on the NES. Mega Man 7 is the first and only numbered title in the original series released on the SNES. Capcom had begun its Mega Man X spin-off series on the console more than a year before.[12] Due to \"bad timing\", the development team had to work under a very tight, three month schedule to complete Mega Man 7.[2][13] The franchise's primary artist Keiji Inafune, credited as \"Inafking\", felt that due to the team's high motivation during that time, it was a very fun experience for him personally. The new head illustrator Hayato Kaji, credited as \"H.K\", concurred, stating that the team was very devoted to the project's completion despite having to rush its development.[2] Designer Yoshihisa Tsuda, credited as \"Hisayoshi\", recounted, \"I remember it being quite fun, like a sports team camp or something. Still, there are so many things about this title that I have regrets about, and even at the time we all found ourselves wishing for another month or so to work on it.\"[2] Inafune takes credit for designing the character Auto, who is based on stereotypical \"tin man\" robots he remembered seeing as a child.[2] Inafune also did the initial rough sketches of Bass and Treble, which bear the names \"Baroque\" and \"Crush\" in his sketchbook.[14] The ideas for these two characters were ultimately handed off to Kaji for design.[2] As with many other games in the series, the eight Robot Masters featured in Mega Man 7 are the product of design contests held for fans by Capcom in Japan. Capcom received around 220,000 character submissions.[2]One of the development team's goals was to add locations where the Master Weapons can be used to interact with the environments of many stages.[2] In addition, Inafune wanted to include a hidden boss battle mode and recommended the idea to Tsuda, who discussed the matter privately with the game's playtester. Just one week before the game went beta, the team decided to include this mode on the conditions that Mega Man and Bass be the only playable characters and that it would have no bugs. It was completed and included within two days.[2] However, Capcom only made this mode accessible via a secret password.[6][11][15] The team also intentionally made the game's final boss \"insanely hard\" and \"something that cannot be defeated without the use of an Energy Tank\".[2] The beta for the original Japanese and overseas versions of Mega Man 7 occurred simultaneously.[2] The translated localizations of the game contain less dialogue than their Japanese equivalent. When Mega Man gains a new weapon in the North American version, he speaks with Dr. Light; in the Japanese version, Mega Man may exchange banter with Roll or Auto as well as Dr. Light.[15]Gregory Ballard, the president of Capcom's North American division, admitted the company was too conservative in shipping copies of Mega Man 7 when it launched in the region during the fall of 1995. The demand for Capcom's released titles apparently did not meet the supply the previous year, causing the company to scale back during that particular release quarter.[16] The music and sound composition of Mega Man 7 was a collaboration of ten people, including Ippo Yamada, credited as \"Ippo\", who was pulled in to work on the game while he was working on another project.[17][18] A CD soundtrack for Mega Man 7 containing 37 pieces of music was published for the first time in Japan by Team Entertainment on November 21, 2007 amidst the franchise's 20th anniversary.[19] Three of Mega Man 7's composers, Yamada, Yuko Takehara, who was credited as \"Yuk\", and Makoto Tomozawa, credited as \"V-Tomozoh\", would later compose the soundtrack to Mega Man 10 along with composers from previous installments and Mega Man 8.Critically, Mega Man 7 has received a consistently average reception in both past reviews and more contemporary retrospectives. A large amount of criticism arose from the game's alleged failure to bring anything new to an already aging series, with some considering it inferior to Mega Man X, which Capcom had released on the SNES more than a year prior.[1][11][20][21][24][25] Tony Mott of Super Play found the game to lack improvement over its 8-bit counterparts in gameplay, stating that the level layouts are \"muted and appear regular when compared to the X series\".[1] Brett Elston of GamesRadar similarly noted Mega Man 7 as feeling far too similar to the earlier games and that it pales in comparison to the SNES's more relevant and inventive Mega Man X.[11] GamePro simply called it \"a nice holdover\" for fans waiting for the next game in the X series.[20]Lucas M. Thomas of IGN described the introduction of Mega Man's rival Bass as the seventh installment's most important contribution to the franchise. In spite of Mega Man 7 technologically moving the series from its NES roots to the next generation of consoles, it would eventually transition back to an NES visual and audio style similar to the first six titles many years later.[6] Mega Man 7 has been officially re-released three separate times since its 1995 debut, first on the Nintendo Power cartridge service in Japan, second on the Mega Man Anniversary Collection in North America for the PlayStation 2 and GameCube in 2004 and the Xbox in 2005[26][27][28] and third for the Wii U Virtual Console in 2014.[29]","title":"Mega Man 7","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/27/Mega_Man_7_Coverart.jpg/220px-Mega_Man_7_Coverart.jpg","developer":"Capcom","genre":"2D action"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mega_Man_Soccer","description":"Mega Man Soccer, known in Japan as Rockman's Soccer (ロックマンズサッカー?), is a soccer video game for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System/Famicom. The game is based on the original Mega Man series of action-platform games. Mega Man Soccer was first released in Japan on February 17, 1994 and in North America in April of that same year.Mega Man Soccer is a traditional soccer game with exhibition matches, tournaments, and leagues that can be played both single-player and multiplayer depending on the mode. The game features characters and Robot Masters from previous entries in the original Mega Man series. Each character has a unique special shot that will temporarily disable anyone that comes in contact with the ball. This aspect of Mega Man Soccer was met with critical praise, but overall reception has been average, particularly due to its perceived poor play control.Mega Man Soccer is set after Mega Man 4.[1] A televised soccer game is interrupted when an explosion occurs on the field. As the smoke clears, all the players are suddenly replaced with several of Dr. Wily's Robot Masters.[3][4] Having seen the events occur onscreen, the inventor Dr. Light sends his greatest creation, the hero Mega Man, along with some of his own Robot Masters to stop them.[3] The game has no ending.[5]Mega Man Soccer is a soccer game that allows the player to play as various characters from the Mega Man series including Mega Man, Proto Man, and several Robot Masters. The game features modes of play much like more traditional sports games, such as exhibition matches, tournaments, and leagues.[3][6] The \"Exhibition\" mode lets the player play a single match with a team created using any of the game's 20 characters on one of a dozen themed soccer fields.[3][6] The \"Capcom Championship\" mode can be played either one-player or two-player cooperatively. For the first section of this mode, the player is given a team composed entirely of Mega Man robots, and is tasked with defeating eight teams of Robot Masters in an order of the player's choosing.[3] After beating each team, one member of a team joins the player's team and can then be used, much like how Mega Man can gain the ability of a boss at end of each stage in other entries in the series.[7] After all eight teams are defeated, the player has to defeat several other teams which are faced in a set order in the same way the stages taking place in Dr. Wily's castle—the area that always followed the initial eight boss stages—occur in a set order in other Mega Man games. The \"Tournament\" and \"League\" modes allow one or two players to pick among nine teams and participate in a tiered schedule of games. Teams that neither player pick must simply be watched.[3]Mega Man Soccer has four statistics in which characters differ from one another in ability: running, kicking, tackling, and defense. These statistics are displayed on screen when the player is given the chance to set a formation at the beginning of a match, or make substitutions at halftime. Controls in Mega Man Soccer mostly mirror that of a more realistic soccer game. Individual buttons are mapped to shooting, passing, slide tackling opposing players, and headbutting or chestbumping the ball depending on its proximity to the player.[3] The one feature that is decidedly dissimilar to anything in realistic soccer is the inclusion of \"special attacks\". These shots resemble the abilities used by the characters in other Mega Man games. For example, Cut Man's shot will turn the ball into a pair of cleavers, while Fire Man's shot will set the ball ablaze. Special attacks will temporarily knock down, stun, or otherwise inhibit any character it hits.[3] They generally are much more likely to produce a goal compared to normal shots, but can only be used a few times per game in certain modes.[6][7] Games consist of two five-minute halves followed by five rounds of penalty kicks if the game remains tied. The clock stops while a goalkeeper has the ball or when the ball is out of bounds.Mega Man Soccer was first announced in an interview with Capcom's Senior Vice President Joseph Morici in the March 1993 Game Players magazine.[8] Very little was revealed about the game in the months preceding its Japanese release.[9] Series artist Ryuji Higurashi recalled seeing the characters Guts Man and Heat Man in preview screenshots for Mega Man Soccer. After joining Capcom, he was told by the staff that they planned to include them in a prospective sequel to the game.[1] Guts Man was originally featured as part of a sketch for the game's Japanese cover art; when he was cut from the final draft of the game, he was replaced by Proto Man.[10] Several features found within the game's ROM are noticeably inaccessible from the playable version of the game. These include simultaneous play of up to four players using the SNES Multitap, the ability to play as Dr. Wily, and a closing credits sequence.[5] Although little has been said about the game's musical score, the song \"We Are Rockman\" by Tatsuo Kamon, used in the Japanese television commercial for Mega Man Soccer, was included on the Rockman Theme Song Collection CD.[11]Mega Man Soccer has met with an overall mediocre critical reception from major gaming publications due to its play control. GamePro found that, aside from the special shots, the game featured sluggish controls, slowdown, and repetitive computer AI.[6] Game Players made similar comments regarding sluggish control and slowdown when too many sprites cover the screen, while Nintendo Power cited poor play control \"uncharacteristic of Capcom games\".[7][13] Local newspaper columnists gave the game more positive reviews, such Michael Pflughoeft of The Milwaukee Journal, who felt the game was very easy to play and that the special attacks would be appealing to younger players.[15][16][17]More contemporary retrospectives on the Mega Man series showed mixed opinions on Mega Man Soccer. GamePro ranked the game at number four on its \"10 Weirdest Sports Games Ever\". The list compared it to sports games in the Mario series, stating that the latter makes more sense in having only one of each character, unlike Mega Man Soccer, which can have multiple copies of characters on the field at one time.[18] Bill Barnwell of IGN also mentioned a similarity to the Mario series, but mentioned that the lack of excellent gameplay in Mega Man Soccer causes it to be \"one of the worst soccer games you'll ever play\".[19] 1UP.com's Jeremy Parish contrarily recommended the game, calling it \"nonsensical, sure, but awfully fun.\"[20] GameSpot editors Christian Nutt and Justin Speer summarized, \"Not particularly good or particularly successful, this is a bargain bin curiosity that is an example of weird directions in which to take your mascot.\"[21] Brett Elston of GamesRadar found it entertaining to dismantle opponent robots using the special attacks.[22]","title":"Mega Man Soccer","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/2a/MMSoccerBox.jpg/220px-MMSoccerBox.jpg","developer":"Capcom","genre":"Sports"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mega_Man_X_(video_game)","description":"Mega Man X, known in Japan as Rockman X (ロックマンX?), is a video game developed by Capcom for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES). It is the first Mega Man game for the 16-bit console and the first game in the Mega Man X series, a spin-off of the original Mega Man series that began on the SNES's predecessor, the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). Mega Man X was first published in Japan on December 12, 1993 and was released in both North America and Europe the following year. Taking place a century after the original Mega Man series, Mega Man X is set in a futuristic world populated by both humans and \"Reploids\", robots capable of thinking, feeling, and growing like their human creators. Because of these complex attributes, many Reploids are prone to destructive, criminal activity and are thereafter referred to as \"Mavericks\". The plot of the game follows the protagonist Mega Man X, an android member of a military task force called the \"Maverick Hunters\". With the help of his partner Zero, X must thwart the plans of Sigma, a powerful Maverick leader wishing to bring about human extinction.With the transition to more advanced gaming hardware, series artist Keiji Inafune explained that the development of Mega Man X involved reinventing Mega Man through gameplay expansion and a more mature storyline while still maintaining the basic concepts on which the franchise was built. Much like the NES Mega Man games that came before it, Mega Man X is a standard action-platform game where the player takes control of the eponymous character and must complete a set of eight, initial stages in any order desired. Defeating the boss character at the end of each stage grants the player one new weapon that can then be toggled and used at will for the remainder of the game. However, Mega Man X adds a number of new features and makes radical changes to the original gameplay mechanics of previous releases in the series. These include allowing the player to dash along the ground, scale walls, and obtain armor attachments which grant special abilities.Mega Man X has met with positive reviews for its gameplay, sound, and graphics, as well as its attempt to augment the aging Mega Man franchise. A longterm commercial success on the SNES, Mega Man X has since been ported to personal computers (PCs) and mobile devices, included in the North American Mega Man X Collection for the Nintendo GameCube and PlayStation 2 (PS2), and released on the Virtual Console download service for the Wii and the Wii U. The game also received an enhanced remake on the PlayStation Portable (PSP) titled Mega Man Maverick Hunter X, or Irregular Hunter X (イレギュラーハンターX?) in Japan.Mega Man X takes place in an unspecified time during the 22nd century (21XX) and approximately 100 years after the original Mega Man series.[3][17] A human archaeologist named Dr. Cain discovers the ruins of a robotics research facility that had once been operated by the legendary robot designer Dr. Thomas Light.[18] Among the ruins, Cain finds a large capsule which contains a highly advanced robot with human-level intelligence and emotions, and even free will, the likes of which the world has never seen before. Light had wished to instill within his creation reasonable sanity, good nature, and an understanding of the more controversial aspects of human morality. The robot was buried while running a 100-year diagnostic program to ensure these features.[19] Cain spends the next several months studying the robot, who is named Mega Man X, or simply \"X\".[18] Cain decides to duplicate X and, within several months, completes the first \"replicate android\" or \"Reploid\", a robot who can think, feel, learn, and grow exactly like a human. Within the year, the design is standardized and Reploids are mass-produced. However, with the free will given to a Reploid comes the possibility of criminal activity; such rogue Reploids are branded as \"Mavericks\" by law-abiding citizens.[20]The original Mega Man series on the NES has generally consisted of 2D platform games that focus on run-and-gun gameplay. Mega Man X uses the same basic principles as its precursors but with many added options.[24][25][26] The player takes control of the protagonist X, and, after completing an introductory stage, is presented with a stage selection screen that depicts eight boss characters.[24] Each stage is littered with various enemies and hazards and ends with a boss battle against its respective Maverick. Completing a stage rewards the player with a new weapon.[20][24][27] The player may attempt these eight levels in any order, using weapons gained in one level to overcome challenges in the others.[20] The player can return to the game at a later point using a password system; the password will retain any number of the eight stages cleared and most power-ups.[27] Completing some stages will subtly affect the landscape of others. For example, clearing Storm Eagle's aircraft carrier stage will cause electrical outages in Spark Mandrill's power plant stage.[25] In certain stages, X can hop inside Ride Armor to fight enemies. Ride Armor is a bipedal tank capable of powerful punches.[20]X's abilities are similar to those in previous Mega Man games, such as running, jumping, and a chargeable arm cannon named the \"X-Buster\". However, Mega Man X introduces a number of elements not present in the original Mega Man titles.[24][26] One prominent feature is the ability to scale, slide down, or jump off nearly any wall.[20][25][27] Armor part capsules can be found in several stages which display a holographic message from Dr. Light when approached. Each capsule upgrades one of X's body parts—his legs, armor, helmet, or X-Buster—granting the player improved firepower and defense, as well as new abilities, like a dash upgrade.[20][25] The player can also collect hidden \"Heart Tanks\" that extend X's maximum life energy and \"Sub-Tanks\" that can store extra energy for later use.[20][27] When certain conditions are met, a secret capsule can be unlocked which gives X the ability to perform the \"Hadouken\", an attack used by characters from Capcom's Street Fighter series.[25][28]Mega Man X was developed by a team at Capcom which had worked on the long-running Mega Man series for the NES. Lead artist Keiji Inafune (credited as a planner as Inemuryar) recounted that the development of Mega Man X required a lot of brainstorming for its storyline and content where the team's goal was to branch out from original Mega Man games while still maintaining their fundamentals.[3] In the original Mega Man series, Inafune typically designed the protagonist while his protégé Hayato Kaji handled the supporting characters. However, their roles were reversed for Mega Man X.[3] Kaji (credited as Rippa H.K) illustrated the protagonist X, but had a difficult time with the initial design. He was presented with much more freedom than he was accustomed with the SNES's larger palette of colors when compared to the NES.[3] Inafune and Kaji worked simultaneously on the various designs for X with different pieces of armor attached. The idea for the armor parts came about because the game was planned during a time when role-playing video games were becoming extremely popular. Inafune felt that Mega Man had always represented a classic action game formula in which the hero earns his defeated enemies' abilities; the armor parts were added to supplement this concept.[3]Inafune created the character Zero, whom he originally intended to be the game's main, playable protagonist.[3] \"When the X series came out, I really wanted to redesign Mega Man,\" Inafune explained. \"I wanted a totally different Mega Man. I’m a designer, a creator; I wanted something new. I didn’t want to use the same old Mega Man.\"[17] Fearing a negative reaction from fans, Zero was ultimately reduced to a role secondary to Mega Man X.[17][29] The development team additionally wanted the world of Mega Man X to be much more sophisticated than in the first Mega Man series. They wanted to accomplish this with Zero's \"hardcore\" personality and the game's antagonist Sigma. As stated by Inafune, the original series' villain Dr. Wily had \"a side to him you couldn't really hate\". Sigma, however, was written as a once-good character suffering an \"unforeseen error\" that leads him to be completely evil.[3] Mega Man X altered the franchise tradition of having themed boss characters with a \"Man\" moniker by replacing them with anthropomorphic, cyborg animals.[28][30] The art and pixelization for these eight bosses were divided among three illustrators: Inafune did Storm Eagle and Chill Penguin; Kaji did Spark Mandrill, Launch Octopus, and Sting Chameleon; and Kazunori Tazaki (credited as Ikki) did Flame Mammoth, Armored Armadillo, and Boomer Kuwanger. The team was careful in making the bosses distinct from one another in both stature and coloring.[3] Tatsuya Yoshikawa (credited as Tatsunoko), a fourth artist who had recently been hired by Capcom, was given the task of assisting the rest of the team by designing, illustrating, and creating the sprites for the game's minor enemies.[3] The musical score for Mega Man X was composed by Capcom's Alph Lyla group. Setsuo Yamamoto (credited as Setsuo) was initially the sole composer assigned to the game, and contributed the vast majority of the soundtrack, but four other composers, Yuki Iwai (credited as Sato), Toshihiko Horiyama (credited as Kirry), Yuko Takehara (credited as Yuko) and Makoto Tomozawa (credited as Tomozou), were brought in late in production to help finish the soundtrack. Iwai and Horiyama would later compose the soundtracks for Mega Man X2 and X4 respectively. The Japanese division of Sony Records published an arranged album featuring ten songs on March 9, 1994.[31] Music using the SNES instrumentals was included as part of the Capcom Music Generation: Rockman X1 ~ X6 soundtrack released by Suleputer in 2003.[32]The success of the Mega Man series allowed Capcom to continue releasing NES titles well into the 16-bit era.[30] A teaser for an SNES incarnation of the Mega Man series first made its way into a preview of Mega Man 6 in the spring 1993 issue of the Japanese Club Capcom fan magazine.[33] Mega Man X was announced in North America in a March 1993 Game Players magazine interview with Capcom's Senior Vice President Joseph Morici. The tentatively titled \"Super Mega Man\" was originally to have a \"fairly large memory configuration and a battery backup\".[34] The autumn 1993 issue of Club Capcom announced Rockman X for a December 1993 release in Japan, divulged several plot and gameplay details, and showed Zero as a silhouetted \"Blues-like character\".[35] Leading up to its release, the game was covered by the North American press surrounding the summer 1993 and winter 1994 Consumer Electronics Shows.[36][37][38][39][40]Mega Man X has been widely acclaimed by critics since its release. Gaming magazines in the United States and Europe including Electronic Gaming Monthly (EGM), GamePro, Game Players, Nintendo Power, Super Play, and the German version of Total! consistently lauded the game's visuals, audio, control, and overall gameplay.[5][20][24][30][42][43][44] Game Players summarized Mega Man X as \"a near-perfect cart with classic gameplay, excellent graphics and sound and tons of hidden items and power-ups\".[43] Websites such as IGN, GameSpot, GamesRadar, and 1UP.com retrospectively held Mega Man X as a successful milestone in transitioning the Mega Man series from its increasingly stale existence on the NES to the SNES.[25][28][30][45] Brett Elston of GamesRadar stated, \"X was a total reinvention of the series, a perfectly executed update that had fans anticipating its release with a fervor the franchise hadn't seen since the Mega Man 2 and 3 days.\"[28]Mega Man X received criticism from some publications as well. Ed Semrad, Danyon Carpenter, and Al Manuel of the EGM review panel all noted that the game may have too low a difficulty level; Semrad disliked the introductory stage and felt that the game was too short as well.[42] Super Play editor Zy Nicholson lowered his review score of the game because he found the levels were neither large nor challenging. \"A few elementary tricks like repeating easy sections to recoup energy and weapon power will see you through the harder bits,\" Nicholson explained. \"Within the level you'll also find restart points, extra lives, and no harsh time limit to put pressure on your performance. Couple this with a password system that records your level completion, status and weapon accumulation and you'll see we're not looking at a lasting challenge for the experienced player.\"[44]Mega Man X was ranked number 58 in Nintendo Power's \"100 Best Nintendo Games of All Time\" in its 100th issue in September 1997, number 103 in the publication's \"Top 200 Games\" list for its 200th issue in February 2006, and the 11th best SNES game of all time in its August 2008 issue.[47][48][49] Both GamesRadar and ScrewAttack listed Mega Man X as the eighth best game in the SNES library.[50][51] GamePro similarly listed it as the eighth greatest 16-bit video game.[52] Game Informer considered it the 120th best game of all time in its own 200th issue in December 2009.[53] IGN named it the twelfth-best on its own top 100 SNES games list in 2011.[54]Mega Man X was a commercial success. The SNES version has sold 1.16 million copies worldwide to date, making it the 41st best-selling Capcom game of all time.[55][56] IGN's Jeremy Dunham speculated that the game's more mature storyline and its inclusion of numerous gameplay extensions over the original Mega Man series helped create a \"unique cadre of fans\".[57] The game was followed by seven direct sequels and three related titles: Mega Man Xtreme, Mega Man Xtreme 2, and Mega Man X Command Mission.[28] Another video game spin-off series, Mega Man Zero, began in 2002 on the Game Boy Advance handheld as a result of the immense popularity of the character Zero.[17][26][28]After the SNES version debuted, Mega Man X was ported by Rozner Labs to the IBM PC in 1995 and was packaged with a six-button game controller.[6] Mega Man X received a separate PC release in Japan in 1996.[3] Majesco republished the SNES version of the game in 1997.[1] Nintendo of Japan also republished the game on its SNES Nintendo Power cartridge service in 1998.[58] Mega Man X, alongside its next five direct sequels and Mega Man Battle & Chase, was compiled and made available on the Mega Man X Collection in North America for the Nintendo GameCube and PS2 in 2006.[59]An enhanced remake titled Mega Man Maverick Hunter X, or Irregular Hunter X (イレギュラーハンターX?) in Japan, was released worldwide for the PSP between 2005 and 2008.[13][14][15][16] With the launch of the PSP, Keiji Inafune and his team debated on whether or not to create a Mega Man X9. \"So, we decided that instead of going the X9 route, let's go back to the series' roots and rediscover what makes the X series so classic,\" Inafune concluded. \"We felt that the best way to do that would be to make an X remake.\"[60] Although the remake stays true to the original game in both gameplay and basic storyline, Maverick Hunter X features a total graphical overhaul with 3D character models and backgrounds, a remixed soundtrack, voice acting, and anime cutscenes.[61][62] According to Yoshikawa, the character illustrations were updated to resemble both toys and the designs of Mega Man X8.[13]Capcom released a port of Mega Man X onto FOMA and i-mode compatible mobile phones in Japan in 2007.[7] Mega Man X has also been made available for purchase on the Virtual Console service in Japan and North America in 2011 for the Wii, and later in Europe in 2012, as well as for the Wii U in 2013.[8][9][10] The game was ported to the Android operating system in Japan as a free download on November 18, 2011.[11] Another remake of Mega Man X was released on the Apple iOS (iPhone and iPod Touch) on December 21, 2011.[12] This version is based on the mobile phone version of the game and features touch controls, Game Center support, and a challenge mode with 80 levels.[69] Weapon and armor upgrades can be purchased to ease the game's difficulty.[12]","title":"Mega Man X","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f1/Mega_Man_X_Coverart.png","developer":"Capcom","genre":"Action"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mega_Man_X2","description":"Mega Man X2, known as Rockman X2 (ロックマンX2?) in Japan, is a video game developed by Capcom for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES). The game was released in Japan on December 16, 1994 and in North America and PAL regions in 1995. It is the direct sequel to Mega Man X, released one year prior. Mega Man X2 takes place in the near future in which humans try to peacefully coexist with intelligent robots called \"Reploids\", with some of the Reploids going \"Maverick\" and threatening daily life. The plot follows the android protagonist X, a \"Maverick Hunter\" who has saved humanity from the evil Sigma six months earlier. A trio of Mavericks calling themselves the \"X-Hunters\" has arisen, intent on destroying X by luring him with bodyparts of his comrade Zero, who died in the conflict with Sigma.Mega Man X2 features much of the same action-platforming elements as the first installment of the series, following the traditional gameplay of the original Mega Man series. The player is tasked with completing a series of stages by destroying enemies, gaining various power-ups, and winning the special weapon of each stage's boss. Like the first Mega Man X, this game lets the player dash, scale walls, and obtain access to special abilities via optional pieces of armor. Mega Man X2 is graphically similar to its predecessor as well, but Capcom included the Cx4 in-cartridge enhancement chip to allow for some 3D wireframe effects. The development team was instructed to utilize this technology as much as possible when working on the game.The presentation and gameplay of Mega Man X2 have earned the game a mostly positive critical reception. However, reviewers were dismayed by the lack of changes from the original Mega Man X. Mega Man X2 was included in the Mega Man X Collection for the Nintendo GameCube and PlayStation 2 (PS2) in North America in 2006. The game was also released on Japanese mobile phones in 2008 and 2009 and worldwide on the Virtual Console in 2011 and 2012 for the Wii and in 2013/2014 for the Wii U.Mega Man X2 is set in an ambiguous year during the 22nd century (\"21XX\") in which the world is populated both by humans and mechanical beings known as \"Reploids\" (replicant androids). The mass-produced Reploids are based on a complex, humanoid robot dubbed Mega Man X (or simply \"X\") who was discovered by the archaeologist Dr. Cain in laboratory ruins many months earlier. Created with human-level intelligence and free will, some Reploids have a tendency towards destructive, criminal activity and are subsequently dubbed \"Mavericks\" by the government.[9] A military force called the \"Maverick Hunters\" is formed to halt or prevent such activity. The events of the first Mega Man X game entail the hunter X's fight to stop Sigma, a Maverick overlord bent on the destruction of humanity. X prevails in his mission, but at the cost of his partner Zero's life.[9]Mega Man X2 is an action-platform game in the same fashion as the first Mega Man X and the original Mega Man series. The player takes on the role of the titular character X, who must traverse and clear a series of eight, side-scrolling stages in the order of the player's choosing.[11][16][19] The protagonist's initial abilities include running, jumping, scaling walls, dashing along the ground, and firing his chargeable \"X-Buster\" arm cannon. The player must contend with countless robotic enemies and several platforming hazards such as bottomless pits, deadly spikes, and rising lava.[19] Along the way, the player can pick up extra lives and items that restore health and weapon power.[11] Each stage contains one main boss at the end; defeating the stage's boss will earn the player a special weapon that can be quickly switched to and used in any remaining levels.[11][16] Every boss is weak to another's weapon, so the player may strategize the order in which the stages are completed.Mega Man X2 features a number of extra gameplay elements. At certain times, the player can pilot vehicles including an attack mech in Wheel Gator's stage and an attack hovercycle in Overdrive Ostrich's stage.[11][16] Each of the eight stages contains an optional entrance for a battle with one of the three X-Hunters, should the player select that stage when one of them is present.[16] Defeating an X-Hunter will earn the player a piece of Zero, which may affect the storyline late in the game.[19] Like the first Mega Man X, players can locate and acquire numerous hidden power-ups. \"Heart Tanks\" extend the player's maximum life bar, \"Sub-Tanks\" store life energy for later use, and armor upgrade capsules grant a set of new abilities.[16] For example, the leg part will allow the player to perform a dash in mid-air, while the X-Buster part will allow for two charged blasts in succession.[16][19][20] When specific conditions are met a special capsule is unlocked in one of the game's final stages, allowing X to perform a one-shot kill attack (the \"Shoryuken\") used by characters from Capcom's Street Fighter series.[21]Mega Man X2 was developed by a team at Capcom, which included artists and designers Keiji Inafune, Sho Tsuge, and Yoshihisa Tsuda. A majority of the people who worked on Mega Man X2 had either been heavily involved with the development of the first Mega Man X or were completely new to the franchise.[1] Though he was largely responsible for designing characters for the original Mega Man series as well as Mega Man X, Inafune was \"hands-off\" with the art design in Mega Man X2. He instead began focusing more on directing, producing, and story writing for the newer series beginning with this title.[1] According to Tsuda, it was Inafune's decision to bring Zero back to life in Mega Man X2 simply because he thought it would be \"a shame\" to keep him dead.[1] Inafune felt particularly attached to Zero, a character whom he had originally intended to be the main protagonist of the X series.[22] Even though Inafune had mostly relinquished his character design duties in Mega Man X2, he refused to allow any drastic changes to the illustration of Zero.[23]Mega Man X2 has an in-cartridge enhancement by Capcom called the Cx4 chip, a digital signal processor which allows for limited 3D graphical effects like rotation, enlarging, and shrinking of wireframe objects.[1][19][21][24][25] The company held weekly meetings devoted to utilizing the chip to its maximum potential in Mega Man X2. Tsuge commented that the Cx4 was their \"greatest adversary to date\" as they were instructed to use it in as many ways as possible.[1] The musical score for Mega Man X2 was chiefly composed by Yuki Iwai. Others, such as Ippo Yamada, were involved in some of the game's sound production.[26] Tsuge wanted the Flame Stag stage theme cut from the game, but the song was kept due to its popularity among the development staff.[1] Additionally, the game's ending theme was originally its final boss track. As the team felt it was more appropriate for the ending music, it was slightly altered and made as such.[1] The Mega Man X2 soundtrack, featuring the original SNES instrumentals, was included as part of the Capcom Music Generation: Rockman X1 ~ X6 compilation released by Suleputer in 2003.[27]Reception for Mega Man X2 has been primarily positive by virtue of its graphics, sound, and a persistently enjoyable gameplay model which critics and fans of the Mega Man series had come to expect.[20][21][25][28][29] Comparing the game to the first Mega Man X, GamePro '​s Chris Nicolella called Mega Man X2 \"improved in almost every way\". Nicolella summarized, \"The new C4 chip energizes the already great graphics, the extremely responsive controls are perfect and the levels contain more enemies and hidden locations than any MM cart yet.\"[29] Dave Halverson of GameFan likewise enjoyed the level designs and judged the new armor abilities and the music to be better than the original Mega Man X.[20] GameSpot editors Christian Nutt and Justin Speer were appreciative of Capcom's attempt at expanding Mega Man X2 over its predecessor in all aspects, especially the story, which they called \"involving ... with engaging characters\".[21] IGN named Mega Man X2 as the 31st-best game in its list of the top 100 SNES games of all time. \"Following up the explosive debut of the Mega Man X series was no small task,\" the website abstracted, \"but Mega Man X2 accomplished the job admirably.\"[32]In spite of the general praise given to Mega Man X2, some sources complained of its lack of deviation from Mega Man X and earlier games in the series.[19][24][25][33] Both Jeremy Parish and Nadia Oxford of 1UP.com found the game a forgettable entry in the franchise. Parish stated that although it carried the plot of the first Mega Man X forward, the game itself was simply \"more of the same ... but not as good\".[33] Oxford commented, \"In light of Mega Man 2's vast improvement over the original Mega Man, Mega Man X2's feeble innovations are disappointing.\"[24] Aside from thinking it was uninspired, Super Play columnists Zy Nicholson and Wil Overton felt that Mega Man X2 did not use Capcom's Cx4 chip to its maximum potential. The writers were unimpressed by the 3D graphics of the sparse in-game instances where the Cx4 is used, particularly when compared to late-1994 SNES releases like Donkey Kong Country and Street Racer, neither of which use added cartridge technology.[19]In 2006, Mega Man X2 was included as part of the North American Mega Man X Collection for the GameCube and PS2.[34] A version for i-mode and EZweb-compatible mobile phones was made available in Japan between 2008 and 2009.[4][5] Mega Man X2 was released on the Wii Virtual Console service in Japan on December 27, 2011, in PAL regions on May 31, 2012, and in North America on June 14, 2012.[6][7][8]","title":"Mega Man X2","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/cb/Mmx2_box.jpg/250px-Mmx2_box.jpg","developer":"Capcom","genre":"Action"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mega_Man_X3","description":"Mega Man X3, known as Rockman X3 (ロックマンX3?) in Japan, is a video game developed by Capcom for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES). The game was originally released in Japan on December 1, 1995 and later in North American and PAL regions in 1996. It is the third game in the Mega Man X series and the last to appear on the SNES. Mega Man X3 takes place in a fictional future in which the world is populated by humans and intelligent robots called \"Reploids\". Like their human creators, some Reploids involve themselves in destructive crime and are labelled as \"Mavericks\". After twice defeating the Maverick leader Sigma, the heroes Mega Man X and Zero must battle a Reploid scientist named Dr. Doppler and his utopia of Maverick followers.Mega Man X3 follows in the tradition of both the original Mega Man series and the Mega Man X series as a standard action-platform game. The player traverses a series of eight stages in any order while gaining various power-ups and taking the special weapon of each stage's end boss. Mega Man X3 is the first game in the series in which Zero is a playable character in addition to X. Like its predecessor, Mega Man X2, X3 features the \"Cx4\" chip to allow for some limited 3D vector graphics and transparency effects.A 32-bit version of Mega Man X3 was released on the PlayStation, Sega Saturn, and Windows in various countries. This version was included on the North American Mega Man X Collection in 2006. The game was also ported to Japanese mobile phones in 2010. Critical reception for Mega Man X3 has been above average. However, the game, particularly the 32-bit version, has received miscellaneous criticism from reviewers for its lack of improvements to the series.Capcom announced that Mega Man X3 would be coming to the Wii U Virtual Console in 2014.[7] It was released in North America on August 28, 2014,[8] Japan on October 8, 2014 and the PAL regions on November 6, 2014.The story of Mega Man X3 is set during the 22nd century (the year \"21XX\"), in which humans coexist with intelligent robots called \"Reploids\" (replicant androids). Due to their free will, some Reploids are prone to criminal activity and are said to go \"Maverick\". Dr. Cain, the inventor of the Reploids, establishes a military taskforce called the \"Maverick Hunters\" to prevent it.[4] Even after two successful efforts by the Hunters Mega Man X and Zero to stop a Maverick leader named Sigma from attempting to exterminate the human race, Maverick activity seems to continue.[4] However, the threat of the Mavericks is later neutralized thanks to the technology of the Reploid scientist Dr. Doppler, which prevents the Mavericks from going berserk.[4] The reformed Reploids form a utopia near their new mentor called \"Dopple Town\".[9] It seemed that all is well until the former Reploids suddenly revert and once again begin causing trouble, even going so far as to attack Hunter headquarters. Doppler is held accountable, and X and Zero are sent out to contain the new threat.[4][10]Mega Man X3 adopts the gameplay of Mega Man X and Mega Man X2, an expansion of the gameplay model of the original Mega Man series. These action-platform games involve taking control of the protagonist X and completing a series of eight, selectable stages.[4] Each stage has a variety of obstacles, traps, and enemy robots to fight. The stage terminates in a Maverick boss fight; defeating this boss will add a new special weapon to the player's arsenal.[4][15][16] Each boss is particularly weak to one special weapon, so the player may complete the stages in an order that best exploits these weaknesses.[17] The player character X retains certain abilities from past games. Namely, he is able to run, jump, dash, cling to and scale most walls, and fire his chargeable \"X-Buster\" arm cannon and special weapons.[16] The player can further upgrade X's abilities by collecting armor parts (head, body, legs, and X-Buster) found within capsules in some levels.[15] Capsules containing special chips add new abilities as well. X is generally only able to benefit from one chip at a time, allowing the player to customize the character as needed.[18]Like the two previous Mega Man X games, the player can locate power-ups such as \"Heart Tanks\" for extending the maximum life energy and \"Sub-Tanks\" for storing energy for later use.[16] Also returning are powerful \"Ride Armor\" vehicles that can be piloted in some of the stages.[15] Items hidden within certain levels can be collected which allow the player to summon vehicles at any time.[16] Mega Man X3 is the first game in the series which allows the player to play as X's ally Zero.[19][20] Zero can be called to take X's place during nearly any stage, but he cannot collect any of X's armor parts or power-ups, and cannot fight end-stage bosses.[15][16][17]Mega Man X3 was developed by Capcom. By the time production began, Keiji Inafune, a major contributor to the Mega Man franchise, had transitioned from his role as an artist to that of a director, producer, and writer.[1] Starting with Mega Man X2, Inafune wanted to advance the narrative using a computer virus as a plot device, something he considered a more interesting idea than a tangible villain.[21] Inafune's other duties included merchandising the game into toys and trading cards. Although the character designs and artwork were done at Capcom, Inafune recalled experiencing \"psychological turmoil\" over allowing \"outsiders\" to handle the game's development.[1] Inafune's only illustrative designs for the game were the characters X, Zero, and Vile. Inafune admitted being very \"possessive\" of Zero, which he had vested interest in since the character's creation for the first Mega Man X.[1] All of the designs for the game's other characters, bosses, and its minor enemies were divided among artists Hayato Kaji, Tatsuya Yoshikawa, Shinsuke Komaki, and Kazushi Itou.[1] Due to the pressures of the development timescale and various other factors, some of the level designs and the soundtrack production were outsourced to third-party developer Minakuchi Engineering, who had previously handled the line of Mega Man games on the Game Boy.[1]Mega Man X3 is graphically similar to its two predecessors, and even utilizes the SNES Cx4 from Mega Man X2. This digital signal processor cartridge chip allows for basic 3D graphical effects such as rotation, enlarging, and shrinking of wireframe objects.[19][22][23] The North American and the European SNES version of Mega Man X3 are very rare due to they limited run and the fact that they were released during declining support of the console.[17][24] Despite higher-than-expected retail orders for their SNES products, Capcom had lowered its shipping of 16-bit titles during the fall 1995 release quarter due to supply and demand.[25][26] In more recent times, Mega Man X3 cartridges fetch very large sums of money on collector and auction websites such as eBay.[19][24][27] A port of Mega Man X3 was released on the Sega Saturn and PlayStation in Japan in 1996 and in Europe in 1997.[1][4] A Windows port of this 32-bit edition was released in Japan in 1997 and in North America in 1998.[1][5] The port versions feature additional animated full-motion video cutscenes, rearranged music tracks, and different sound effects than the original SNES version.[4][17][28][29] A port for the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer was announced in Japan in 1996, but was not released.[30] The Japanese PlayStation version of Mega Man X3 was eventually re-released as part of the Sony \"The Best for Family\" line of budget titles.[31] The PlayStation version of Mega Man X3 was included in Mega Man X Collection, released for the PlayStation 2 and Nintendo GameCube in North America in early 2006.[27][28] Finally, Mega Man X3 was released on EZweb-compatible mobile phones in Japan in 2010.[6]Press reception for Mega Man X3 has been above average. Reviewers praised the game's tried-and-true gameplay, graphics, control, and the option to play as Zero.[17][19][22][23][36][37] Mike Weigand of GamePro was generally pleased with the game, and, though he admitted it brought little new to the franchise, enjoyed the increased difficulty, tight controls, and new special effects. Weigand summarized, \"It may be routine for experience players, but anyone who hasn't played a 16-bit game in the series will discover Mega magic.\"[22] GameFan reviewer Dave Halverson was equally impressed by the \"speed, diversity, special FX, and power up's,\" calling it \"a fitting 16-bit finale to a great series\".[37] IGN similarly asserted Mega Man X3 as \"a solid send-off for the 16-bit era\", naming it the 67th-best SNES of all time on a 2011 list.[20]Mega Man X3 has received some miscellaneous critique stemming from its similarity to past Mega Man games.[19] Super Play writer Jonathan Davies found the game far too similar to Mega Man X2, questioning whether or not \"Capcom are cashing in on their loyal fans\".[23] Likewise, 1UP.com writer Jeremy Parish thought that the game differed very little from past releases, complaining that it was \"more of the same, but with a kitchen-sink design philosophy that made every single level feel like a sluggish, ill-designed mess.\"[42] GameSpot editors Christian Nutt and Justin Speer specifically felt the number of power-ups and bonuses overshadowed the gameplay, barely benefitting from the addition of Zero as a limited playable character.[17]The port versions of the game suffered more negative criticism than their SNES counterpart. The level designs and overall gameplay were highly criticized by Computer Games Magazine contributor Nathan Smith, who reviewed the late Windows release of the game. \"Packing more cliché console conventions than you can shake a gamepad at,\" Smith opined, \"you'll need the patience of Job, the manual dexterity of a nine-year-old, and the intelligence of Forrest Gump to really enjoy this one.\"[41] Saturn Power denoted Mega Man X3 the worst Saturn title in the console's available game library.[40] Matt Yeo of Sega Saturn Magazine had fair comments about Mega Man X3 as an SNES game, but labeled the UK Saturn version \"a bit of a travesty\" due to its lack of innovation and a \"dubious\" quality of the anime cutscenes.[4] Halverson enjoyed the use of redbook audio in the 32-bit conversion despite not finding the music particularly memorable.[29] Both Yeo and Harvelson were dismayed by the use of letterbox borders in the Saturn version, which horizontally reduce the screen size.[4][29]","title":"Mega Man X3","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/17/Mmx3_box.jpg/220px-Mmx3_box.jpg","developer":"Capcom","genre":"Action"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_Combat:_Falcon%27s_Revenge","description":"","title":"Metal Combat: Falcon's Revenge","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/14/MetalcombatSNES_boxart.jpg/256px-MetalcombatSNES_boxart.jpg","developer":"Intelligent Systems","genre":"Shooter"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_Marines","description":"Metal Marines is a real-time strategy video game developed by Namco for both the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and Windows 3.1 PCs.

In the game, the player controls Mickey Mouse, who must navigate through various side-scrolling levels, each designed and based from classical Mickey Mouse cartoons from 1928 to 1990. The game was later released on PlayStation in Europe and Australia as Mickey's Wild Adventure and was later released in Europe and Australia on the PlayStation Store on July 10, 2012. The box stated that Mickey Mania was the first video game to feature animations by real Disney animators. This is also known as the first game that video game designer David Jaffe worked on.[2]Mickey Mania is a platformer in which players control Mickey Mouse as he visits various locations based on his past cartoons, ranging from his debut in Steamboat Willie to the more recent The Prince and the Pauper. Mickey can attack enemies by either jumping on them or by using a limited supply of marbles, which are collected throughout the level. Mickey can take up to five hits, represented by the fingers he holds up on his hand, which can be replenished by collecting stars, whilst extra lives can be gained by finding Mickey hats. Levels offer a variety of challenges such as puzzles the player must solve, escaping from a rampaging moose and fleeing from a flaming staircase.Originally, Mickey Mania was planned as a game to be released as part of Mickey's 65th birthday. However, as that would have only allowed for six months to develop the game, this idea was soon scrapped in favor of the more compelling concept of Mickey traveling back in time to his own original classic cartoons and subsequently recreating the events of the aforementioned shorts in the process. The game pays tribute to Mickey's whole cartoon career (released in 1994, the year after Mickey's 65th birthday).On release, Famicom Tsūshin scored the Super Famicom version of the game a 28 out of 40,[3] giving the Mega Drive version a 30 out of 40.[4][5] GamePro gave the Genesis version a mixed review. They particularly applauded the visual style and the motif of playing inside old cartoons, commenting that \"The blend of past and present is magical.\" However, they criticized that the game is too easy and concluded that \"If Mickey's not your thing, you won't appreciate this cart. But if you liked any of Mickey's other games, you won't miss with Mickey Mania.[6] A different GameProreviewer covered the SNES version, and in contrast found that the game's difficulty was too high for younger gamers. However, he praised the responsive controls and sharp graphics.[7]","title":"Mickey Mania","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/05/Mickey_Mania.jpg","developer":"Traveller's Tales","genre":"Platformer"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mickey%27s_Ultimate_Challenge","description":"","title":"Mickey's Ultimate Challenge","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a9/Mickey%27s_Ultimate_Challenge_cover.jpg/220px-Mickey%27s_Ultimate_Challenge_cover.jpg","developer":"WayForward Technologies","genre":"Puzzle"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro_Machines_(video_game_series)#Micro_Machines","description":"Micro Machines is a series of computer and video games featuring toy cars, developed by Codemasters and published on several platforms (including Nintendo Entertainment System, Amiga, Sega Mega Drive/Genesis, Super Nintendo Entertainment System, Game Boy, PlayStation 2 and Sega Game Gear) between 1991 and 2006.

The 12 available characters each have different special attacks.Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the Game Gear version of the first game a 6.75 out of 10, citing the variety of unique track settings, good graphics, and general fun of the game.[6] GamePro was more critical; they commented that the game is very charming with its track designs and props, but that the sounds are average even by Game Gear standards and the races \"aren't that involving\", citing the sameness of the vehicles and the lack of a clock. They nonetheless concluded that \"Younger gamers will eat up this sugary game, though veterans may get a toothache from all the sweetness.\"[7] The game was ranked the 14th best game of all time by Amiga Power,[8] while Mega placed the game at #10 in their Top Mega Drive Games of All Time.[9] MegaTech gave the game 92% and a Hyper Game award.[10]The 93% review in Mega described Micro Machines 2: Turbo Tournament as \"multi-player fun at its best\".[11]","title":"","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b9/Micro_Machines_logo.png/250px-Micro_Machines_logo.png","developer":"Codemasters","genre":""},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Might_and_Magic_II:_Gates_to_Another_World","description":"","title":"Might and Magic Book Two: Gates To Another World","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/dc/Might_and_Magic_II_Coverart.png","developer":"New World Computing","genre":"Role-playing video game"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Might_and_Magic_III:_Isles_of_Terra","description":"Might and Magic III: Isles of Terra is the third game in the role-playing video game series Might and Magic.

Parker Brothers was unaware of the games until it learned of one version that stated that it was \"A Parker Brother game\" on the title screen. The company began enforcing its copyright and trademark on Monopoly.[1]The first of the legally licensed commercial adaptations were released in 1985 with the release of Monopoly for the BBC Micro, Amstrad CPC and ZX Spectrum. Over the years, Monopoly has been released for different operating systems on the PC and Macintosh platforms. Also, versions have been licenced and produced for the NES, Super NES, Game Boy, Game Boy Advance, Nintendo 64, Nintendo GameCube, PlayStation, PlayStation 2, Sega Master System, Sega Genesis, Xbox, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, PlayStation Portable, and Wii consoles, as well as mobile device (PDA/Smartphone) versions.In 1998, Hasbro Interactive released a Monopoly video game for Microsoft Windows, which used 3D graphics instead of the top-down design used in previous versions. It ran on Windows 95 (although can be run on up to Windows XP, but won't work on Windows Vista and up) and had a special online play feature which used a modem.EA's Monopoly game scored fairly poorly, with a 54% average on the PS3 on Metacritic,[3] and 56% on the Xbox 360.[4] The Wii version fared better with 70%.[5]EuroGamer was less enthusiastic, saying: \"For the price of Monopoly for Wii, you could buy real Monopoly.

It was subsequently released by Acclaim Entertainment for nearly every home video game platform of the time.The game introduced many key aspects of the Mortal Kombat series, including the unique five-button control scheme and gory finishing moves. The game focuses on the journey of the monk Liu Kang to save Earth from the evil sorcerer Shang Tsung, ending with their confrontation in the tournament known as Mortal Kombat.Mortal Kombat became a best-selling game and remains one of the most popular fighting games in the genre's history, spawning numerous sequels and spin-offs over the following years and decades, beginning with Mortal Kombat II in 1993, and together with the first sequel was the subject of a successful film adaptation in 1995. It also sparked much controversy for its depiction of extreme violence and gore using realistic digitized graphics, resulting in the introduction of age-specific content descriptor ratings for video games.Mortal Kombat is a fighting game in which players battle opponents in one-on-one matches. The fighter that completely drains the opponent's health bar first wins the round, and the first to win two rounds wins the match. Each round is timed; if both fighters still have health remaining when time runs out, the one with more health wins the round.Players select one of seven characters. Whereas other fighting games had characters with considerable differences in speed, height, attacks, strength, jumping heights and distances, the playable characters in Mortal Kombat are virtually identical to one another with only minimal differences in their moves' range and speed. The game also distinguished itself from other fighting games of the time with its unique control scheme. The controls consist of five buttons arranged in an \"X\" pattern: four buttons for high and low punches and kicks with a block button at the center, as well as an eight-way joystick. Attacks can vary depending on the player's distance from the opponent. All player characters have a shared set of attacks performed by holding the joystick in various directions, such as leg sweep and an uppercut; the latter attack knocks the enemy high into the air and causes a large amount of damage.Mortal Kombat also featured unique ways in which special moves were performed. It was the first game to introduce special moves performed exclusively using the joystick. Most special moves were performed by tapping the joystick, sometimes ending with a button press. Unlike previous one-on-one fighting games, few moves required circular joystick movement. Co-designer Ed Boon later said, \"since the beginning, one of the things that's separated us from other fighting games is the crazy moves we've put in it, like fireballs and all the magic moves, so to speak.\"[2] Another of the game's innovations was the Fatality, a finishing move executed against a defeated opponent to kill them in a gruesome fashion.[3]The game's blocking system also distinguished itself from other fighting games. Unlike Street Fighter characters take a small amount of damage from regular moves while blocking. However, the dedicated block button allows users to defend against attacks without retreating and blocking characters lose very little ground when struck, thus making counterattacks much easier after a successful block. Mortal Kombat also introduced the concept of \"juggling\", knocking an opponent into the air and following up with a combination of attacks while the enemy is still airborne and defenseless. The idea became so popular that it has spread to many other games.In the single player game, players face each of the game's characters in a series of one-on-one matches against computer-controlled opponents, ending in a mirror match against the character that the player has selected. The player must then fight in a series of endurance matches featuring two opponents in each round. A second player can join in at any time to fight against the first player. Between certain levels, players can compete in a minigame called \"Test Your Might\" for bonus points, breaking blocks of various materials by filling a meter past a certain point through rapid button presses; the first material the player must break is wood, followed by stone, steel, ruby, and finally diamond, with each successive material requiring more of the meter to be filled up and thus awarding more points. Two players can compete in the minigame at once and the last two materials are only accessible through two-player mode. The minigame would return in various forms in Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance, Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks and Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe.[4]The game takes place on a fictional island in Earthrealm, where a tournament is being held at Shang Tsung's Island, on which seven of its locations serve as stages in the game. The introduction to Mortal Kombat II explains that Shang Tsung was banished to Earthrealm 500 years ago and, with the help of the monstrous Goro, is able to seize control of the Mortal Kombat tournament in an attempt to doom the realm.[5] For 500 years straight, Goro has never been defeated in the tournament, and now a new generation of warriors must challenge him. The player receives information about the characters in biographies displayed during the attract mode. Additional information about the characters and their motivations for entering the tournament is received upon completion of the game with each character.The storyline of the first Mortal Kombat was later adapted into Paul W. S. Anderson's film Mortal Kombat, including an animated prequel titled Mortal Kombat: The Journey Begins, released direct-to-video. Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero was made as a prequel to the first game, focusing mostly on the eponymous character. An alternate climax for the first game would be featured on the action-adventure game Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks, which tells an alternate version of the events between the first and second Mortal Kombat tournaments.Mortal Kombat includes seven playable characters, all of whom would eventually become trademark characters and appear in sequels. The game was developed with digitized sprites based on real actors.[6][7] The protagonist of the game is the Shaolin martial artist, Liu Kang, played by Ho Sung Pak, who enters the tournament to defeat the sorcerer, Shang Tsung, the main antagonist and final boss (also played by Sung Pak).Elizabeth Malecki plays the Special Forces agent, Sonya Blade, who is pursuing the Black Dragon mercenary, Kano (played by Richard Divizio). Carlos Pesina plays Raiden, the god of thunder, while his brother Daniel Pesina plays Hollywood movie star Johnny Cage and the Lin Kuei warrior, Sub-Zero, as well as the game's two other ninja characters. The blue color of Sub-Zero's costume was changed to yellow to create the ninja specter, Scorpion, and to green for the game's secret character, Reptile (though the costume used for motion capture was actually red).[8] Mortal Kombat would become famous for these palette swaps, and later games would continue to use the technique to create new characters.The four-armed Shokan warrior, Goro serves as the sub boss of the game; being a half-human, half-dragon beast, he is much stronger than the other characters, and cannot be affected by some of their attacks. The character's sprites are based on a stop motion model which was created by Curt Chiarelli. When fighting on the Pit stage, the player could qualify to fight the secret character, Reptile, by meeting a special set of conditions.[9] Goro, Shang Tsung, and Reptile were not playable in the original game, but would become playable in sequels. The Masked Guard in the Courtyard stage was portrayed by Mortal Kombat developer John Vogel.[10]Creators Ed Boon and John Tobias have stated that Midway tasked them with the project of creating a \"combat game for release within a year\", which the two believed was intended to compete with the popular Street Fighter II.[11] Mortal Kombat was reportedly developed in 10 months from 1991 to 1992, with a test version seeing limited release halfway through the development cycle.[11][12] In an interview with the Official Nintendo Magazine, Boon stated that the development team initially consisted of four people - himself as programmer, artists John Tobias and John Vogel, and Dan Forden as sound designer.[13] The final arcade game used eight megabytes of graphics data, with each character having 64 colors and around 300 frames of animation.[14]The team had difficulty settling on a name for the game. Boon has stated that for six months during development \"nobody could come up with a name nobody didn't hate.\" Some of the names suggested were Kumite, Dragon Attack, Death Blow and Fatality. One day, someone had written down \"combat\" on the drawing board for the names in Boon's office and someone wrote a K over the C, according to Boon, \"just to be kind of weird.\" Pinball designer Steve Ritchie was sitting in Boon's office, saw the word \"Kombat\" and said to him, \"Why don't you name it Mortal Kombat?\", a name that Boon stated \"just stuck.\"[17] The series itself frequently uses the letter \"K\" in place of the letter \"C\" when it has the hard C sound.The launch of Mortal Kombat for home consoles by Acclaim Entertainment was one of the largest video game launches of the time. A flood of TV commercials heralded the simultaneous release of all four home versions of the game on September 13, 1993, a date dubbed \"Mortal Monday\".[18] In the same year, an official comic book, Mortal Kombat Collector's Edition, was written and illustrated by the game's designer artist John Tobias and made available through mail order, describing the backstory of the game in a greater detail. The comic book was advertised during the attract mode of the game. The comic book would later be sold normally around the country, although it was quite difficult to get a copy outside of the United States. The entire comic book was later included as a series of unlockable bonuses in Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance.Mortal Kombat: The Album, an album by The Immortals featuring techno songs, was released in May 1994. It features two themes for the game, \"Techno Syndrome\" and \"Hypnotic House\", as well as themes written for each character. \"Techno Syndrome\" was adapted for the 1995 movie soundtrack and incorporated the familiar \"Mortal Kombat!\" yell from the Mortal Monday commercials.[19] Jeff Rovin also penned a novelization of the first Mortal Kombat game, which was published in June 1995 in order to coincide with the release of the first movie. There were also lines of action figures based on the game's characters.In November 1993 Acclaim announced that they had shipped more than three million copies of Mortal Kombat, counting the SNES, Genesis, Game Boy, and Game Gear versions combined.[25]The Sega CD version of the game was released featuring a video intro of the Mortal Monday commercial. This port did not require a code to be entered to access the uncensored content and thus was given an MA-17 rating. While this port was technologically inferior to the better-looking SNES port and had loading times, it resembled the arcade version more faithfully in actual gameplay. It also featured the authentic CD-DA soundtrack, taken directly from the arcade version, but some of the arenas feature the wrong music (such as Courtyard playing the Pit's theme). Several remixes of the Mortal Kombat theme music were included as bonus features, including the remix used later for the film adaptation. The gore could be disabled by entering a code at the main menu. Some copies of this version are incompatible with model 1.1 of the Sega CD; Acclaim offered to replace any such discs that were mailed to their Oyster Bay headquarters with working copies.[26]Mortal Kombat was later released in Japan for the Game Gear, Super Famicom, Game Boy and Mega Drive as Mortal Kombat: Legend of the Advent God Fist (モータルコンバット 神拳降臨伝説, Mōtaru Konbatto: Shinken Kōrin Densetsu?)[27] and for the Mega-CD as Mortal Kombat: Legend of the Advent God Fist - Extended Edition (モータルコンバット 神拳降臨伝説 完全版, Mōtaru Konbatto: Shinken Kōrin Densetsu - Kanzenhan?) with no major changes from their first release.With the release of Mortal Kombat: Deception \"Premium Pack\" in 2004, both the Xbox and PlayStation 2 received ports of the game as bonus content. While it was promoted as \"arcade perfect\", there were some issues with the sound and gameplay.[28] That year, Jakks Pacific release the game as one of its Plug It in & Play TV Games. This version of the game is similar to the Super NES version but with different music and the original arcade voices. This port lacks flashing text and a scrolling background layer, so moving objects — such as the clouds on The Pit and Palace Gates stages and the monks in the Courtyard — instead remain static. The programmer of this port was Chris Burke, for developer Digital Eclipse.[29]The game was a part of the 2005 compilation Midway Arcade Treasures: Extended Play. This port features the same controls, graphics and gore that the original game contained, but like Mortal Kombat: Deception \"Premium Pack\", it has sound issues and has no bios of the characters. On August 31, 2011, Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment released Mortal Kombat Arcade Kollection, consisting of Mortal Kombat, Mortal Kombat II and Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, as a downloadable title for PlayStation Network, Xbox Live Arcade and Windows.Electronic Gaming Monthly awarded Mortal Kombat the title of \"Most Controversial Game of 1993\".[34] In 1995, the Daily News wrote, \"the original Mortal Kombat video game debuted in 1992. Its combination of story line, character and mega-violence soon made it a hit worldwide. And the controversy engendered by its blood-gushing special effects only served to boost its popularity.\"[35] In 2004, readers of Retro Gamer voted Mortal Kombat as the 55th top retro game, with the staff commenting that \"future versions would address the limitations of the first game, but this is where it all began.\"[36] CraveOnline ranked it second of the top ten 2D fighters of all time,[37] and Forbes called Mortal Kombat one of the \"most loved arcade games\" that was \"king of the arcade\" in its day, writing that the arcade machines of the original title sell for any price between a few hundred dollars to $2,500.[38] In 2011, Complex ranked the first Mortal Kombat as the 12th best fighting game of all time,[39] while Wirtualna Polska ranked it as the 19th best Amiga game.[40] In 2012, Time named it one of the 100 greatest video games of all time.[41] In 2013, the first Mortal Kombat was ranked as the best arcade game of the 1990s by Complex (the sequel, which \"took everything we loved about the original and magnified it by about a million,\" was given sixth place on the list).[42]The SNES port of Mortal Kombat was widely criticized by gaming media for censorship issues. In 2006, IGN named it as the eighth worst arcade-to-console conversion.[43] Nintendo's decision to make the game more family friendly was also included on GameSpy's list of the dumbest moments in gaming.[20]The Sega CD version was even more harshly criticized by gaming media. The reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly described it as over-hyped with only minor improvements over the Genesis version, and complained of the lag times.[32] GamePro similarly commented \"The original Mortal Kombat is back, this time on CD, and you'd think there'd be some improvements. Think again.\" They criticized that the load times between fights and lag times during fights \"give the game a quirky, out-of-touch feel.\"[44]Mortal Kombat was one of many violent video games that came into prominence between 1992 and 1993, generating controversy among parents and public officials.[45] Hearings on video game violence and the corruption of society, headed by Senators Joseph Lieberman and Herb Kohl, were held in late 1992 to 1993. The legislators were especially concerned with the realistic replica of human figures in games, such as Mortal Kombat, Night Trap and Lethal Enforcers, as opposed to cartoonish characters in other violent games such as Eternal Champions.[46] The result of the hearings was that the entertainment software industry was given one year to form a working rating system or the federal government would intervene and create its own system. Eventually, the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) was conceived, requiring all video games to be rated and for these ratings to be placed on the games' packaging.[47][48][49][50][51]While many games have been subject to urban legends about secret features and unlockable content, these kinds of myths were particularly rampant among the dedicated fan community of the Mortal Kombat series. The game's creators did little to dispel the rumors, some of which were even made reality in subsequent games. The most notable of these myths spawned from an audit-menu listing titled ERMACS (error macro) on the game's diagnostics screen, which led players to believe that another secret character, a red ninja named Ermac, existed in the game, followed by reports of a glitch where the sprites of either Scorpion or Reptile would flash red during gameplay. While both rumors were false, they proved relevant enough that Midway included the character as a playable in Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 and subsequent titles. According to UGO.com, it was also rumored that the SNES version of the game had a cheat code to re-enable the blood and gore, but such a code existed only on the Mega Drive/Genesis version.[52]","title":"Mortal Kombat","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/33/Mortal_Kombat_cover.JPG","developer":"Midway Games","genre":"Fighting"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_versions_of_Mortal_Kombat_II#Console_ports","description":"The 1993 arcade fighting game Mortal Kombat II was later released for a variety of home systems, including the 8-bit (Game Boy, Master System and Sega Game Gear), 16-bit (SNES and Sega Genesis) and 32-bit (Sega 32X, PlayStation and Sega Saturn) consoles, Amiga and PC computers, and the PlayStation Network. The game was also featured in several compilation releases, including as part of Midway Arcade Treasures 2 for the PlayStation 2 and Midway Arcade Treasures: Extended Play for the PlayStation Portable. The early ports were published by Acclaim Entertainment.Developed by Probe Entertainment, the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive port retains all of the blood and Fatalities without a special code having to be entered, unlike the original Mortal Kombat for the system. The game is actually faster than the original arcade version but the visuals are not as brightly colored due to the system's limited color palette.[1] All of the characters' shadows are rendered as an oval instead of the normal silhouette and, due to memory limitations, some voice recordings were left out. The music is more upbeat and the arrangement is markedly different in this game as opposed to the arcade version because the music is synthesized by the console's synthesizer (some of the background music is no longer played with its intended stages). The game requires a six-button joypad for proper input, although, only the low punch is absent on the original three-button controller. Goro's Lair, the secret characters' arena, was removed and replaced with a blue palette swap of the Portal stage. Some of the other arenas are also noticeably missing details.[note 1] The ending screen showing the credits and all of the characters have all been removed; instead, the ending text scrolls over the winner character doing his/her victory stance. The port contains several exclusive Easter eggs[note 2] and features some different character animations for victory poses[note 3] and a support for the motion controller device Sega Activator.The Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) port was developed by Sculptured Software. This particular port has a secret intro (in which a scene between Shao Kahn and Kintaro will take place during the Acclaim logo) and a hidden special team mode. Also in this port is the use of the Super Nintendo's Mode 7, a graphics mode that allows the scaling and rotation of a single background on a scanline-by-scanline basis, during the overhead fall on the Pit II's Stage Fatality.[note 4] However, the game plays with some slowdown[1] and the sprites look like they have been painted rather than photographed due to the image distortion resulted from the downscaling required to match the console's 256x224 display resolution. The SNES has a larger color palette than most other ports of the game and the music is more downbeat and faded in contrast to the Genesis/Mega Drive's upbeat version.[3] John Tobias favored this version over the Genesis version, and added that \"I would go so far as to say that the Super NES version is one of the best arcade-to-home conversions I've seen.\"[4] Because of poor sales of the censored SNES version of the original game, Nintendo decided to allow depictions of blood and Fatalities this time around.[5] Because the industry-wide rating system was not expected to be in effect until November 1994 at the earliest, this version had no formal rating; instead, a warning label was put on the game's box in order to inform prospective buyers about the game's mature content.[6] The Japanese version, however, is censored to a degree, with green blood for all fighters,[7] as well as the screen colors turning black-and-white for all character-specific lethal Fatalities.[8] North America had two different editions released. The second release fixes some major bugs (such as enabling the player to reach Noob Saibot after 50 wins), shows a new company logo at startup, runs an arcade-style attract mode if the game is left alone long enough, and has Johnny Cage's \"Shadow Kick\" randomly leave a red trail rather than the usual green.[3]Developed by Probe Entertainment, the Game Boy port is superior to the Game Boy version of the original game but only contains eight of the 12 playable fighters from the arcade game (lacking Baraka, Johnny Cage, Kung Lao and Raiden); Kintaro and Noob Saibot were also removed from the game. Only three of ten arenas are retained from the arcade version: the Kombat Tomb, the Pit II and Goro's Lair. The Kombat Tomb contains the port's only Stage Fatality and Goro's Lair is much simpler in this version (consisting of a brick wall with no openings or glowing eyes). Blood is completely removed and each playable character retains only one of their Fatalities plus the Babality.Developed by Probe Entertainment, the Sega Game Gear and Master System ports are similar to the Game Boy port, but are in color instead of in monochrome. Both of them are almost identical, except for the reduced size of the Game Gear screen, featuring the same fighters and arenas as the Game Boy port, but with Kintaro.[9] The arena where players fight Jade and Smoke is exclusive to each version. Unlike the Game Boy version, blood is present, even as drastically reduced in quantity as compared to the other ports. Because of the limited graphical resources of the systems, some of the Fatalities in the game were altered to completely destroy the opponent's body, except for the generic gibs of bones and limbs.[note 5] Some of the Fatalities were also simplified to use common animations.[note 6]Developed by Probe Entertainment, the Sega 32X port contains improved graphics over the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive counterpart, with added background details and a bigger color palette to help the visuals come even closer to the arcade version.[1] Although there is a broader variety of sound effects than in the Genesis version,[note 7] the background music is nearly identical to the Genesis version. The 32X version also requires a six-button joypad for proper input.[10] The Japanese version of the port was retitled Mortal Kombat II: Kyuukyoku Shinken (モータルコンバットII 究極神拳, Mōtaru Konbatto Tsū Kyūkyoku Shinken?, \"Mortal Kombat II: Ultimate Godly Fist\")JP,[11] the subtitle being the specific Japanese terminology for the Fatality moves.The PlayStation port was only released in Japan. While the graphics in this port remains close to the arcade game, the sound quality does not and some voice effects are missing. Instead of utilizing the CD-ROM format and converting the music into CD audio tracks, the game uses the PlayStation's own SPU internal sound chip. Loading times occur when performing certain actions (such as Shang Tsung's morph ability): gameplay ceases and the Mortal Kombat II symbol is displayed for 1–2 seconds, rather than being instant like in ROM cartridge-based versions.[note 8]The Sega Saturn port features synthesized music as substitution for the original soundtrack and is missing some sound effects.[note 9] It allows players to preload certain morphs for Shang Tsung, reducing loading lag time but causing a glitch allowing the player to morph between the palette-swap ninja characters.[note 10] An announced[12] compilation release MK Duo from Acclaim was never released.The Amiga port of Mortal Kombat II was released at the very beginning of 1995,[13] developed by Probe Entertainment.[14] This is the first and only Amiga title directly published by Acclaim, as their others games were previously published by Virgin Games, including the first Mortal Kombat. As the Amiga market was reputed slowly dying at this time, this version was unenexpected, even by the Amiga's press.[15][16] The Amiga version has sprite sizes and gameplay nearly identical to the Genesis/Mega Drive version, but lacks multi-layered scrolling and animated backgrounds and uses only a single or two-button joysticks for controls (a two-button joystick option does not work on the Amiga 1200[17]). The game suffers from long loading times and requires a frequent disk-swapping in the machines with less than 1.5 MB RAM. It can be only installed to a hard disk drive through unofficially released installer programs. The sounds effect are improved over the Mega Drive/ Genesis version, adding sounds effects lifted directly from the arcade board.[18][19] The attract mode's demonstration matches always show Johnny Cage and Liu Kang. In this version, Shang Tsung can only morph in his direct opponent.Probe Entertainment was responsible for converting the game to the PC DOS in 1995. The PC version was the best of the early ports and the only problem was it only supported up to four buttons on joypads.[1] Along with the later Sega Saturn and Sony PlayStation versions, this port is among the closest replications of the arcade version. The game came packaged in CD-ROM or floppy disk format, but unlike the Saturn and PlayStation versions, it could be installed onto the user's hard drive to reduce loading times. Because of the PC's less restricted storage capacity, a wider variety of sound effects is available.[note 11] Probe Entertainment chose not to use the PC's CD audio capability for the music, converting the music into synthesized form instead. Music quality varies depending on what type of sound card was installed, ranging from the average quality Sound Blaster's synthesizer to the high quality Roland LAPC-I and Gravis Ultrasound. A later CD-ROM re-release of the game uses CD audio soundtrack, fully reproducing the original arcade music tracks.Mortal Kombat II was re-released in 2004 as a part of Midway Arcade Treasures 2 for the GameCube, PlayStation 2 and Xbox. This version was an emulation of the original arcade game, rather than a port, and thus plays closer to the original Mortal Kombat II arcade game than any version released previous to it. Unfortunately, it suffers from a graphical bug making each characters' shadow sprites flicker; music and sound effects are also prone to cutting out or playing out of sync. Due to a control mapping issue involving the \"Start\" button, it is impossible to fight Smoke, though the \"random select\" can still be activated. The game is also unlockable via either a secret code or by completing Smoke's missions in the game Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks in identical quality to the edition released in Arcade Treasures 2. In 2005, Mortal Kombat II was released on the PlayStation Portable in Midway Arcade Treasures: Extended Play, but with more graphical errors than in Arcade Treasures 2, lacking certain graphics and details from some stages;[note 12] Its animation and sound can also get choppy during the Fatalities, and this version on Midway Arcade Treasures: Extended Play also suffers from heavy loading times. In 2006, Mortal Kombat II was released as part of Midway Arcade Treasures Deluxe Edition for Windows. It featured the same bugs as the console versions and also had missing music. In the two months after its release, two official patches were released for the collection, one to fix the missing music and a second one to correct the button mapping issue that prevented Random Select and the Smoke battle.The 2007 PlayStation Network release of Mortal Kombat II is an arcade-perfect version that also features an online multiplayer.[20] An arcade-perfect compilation release Mortal Kombat Arcade Kollection, consisting of Mortal Kombat, Mortal Kombat II and Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, was released as a downloadable title for the PlayStation 3 via PlayStation Network and the Xbox 360 via Xbox Live Arcade on August 31, 2011.[21] The Windows version was released on Steam on February 2, 2012.[22]","title":"","developer":"","genre":""},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortal_Kombat_3","description":"Mortal Kombat 3 (MK3) is a fighting game developed by Midway Games and first released into arcades in 1995 as the third game in the Mortal Kombat series. As in the previous games, it has a cast of characters that players choose from and guide through a series of battles against other opponents. The game avoids the tournament storyline of its predecessors, as various warriors instead fight against the returning Shao Kahn, who has resurrected his bride Sindel and started an invasion of Earthrealm.Some characters from the previous games returned and new characters were introduced into the series. Mortal Kombat 3 notably omitted popular characters from previous games, some of whom were added in an update, Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, released later in 1995. The home console-exclusive Mortal Kombat Trilogy (1996) added even more characters, as well as other new features.Mortal Kombat 3 builds further on the gameplay of the previous game. A \"Run\" button, accompanied by a \"Run\" meter, was introduced. This was primarily to address concern from fans who thought that the previous games gave too much of an advantage to the defending player. The Run meter is drained by running (the character cannot run backwards, only forwards) and by performing combos.Mortal Kombat 3 follows Mortal Kombat II and shares continuity with both Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 and Mortal Kombat Trilogy which were both updates of this game. The next new chapter in the series was Mortal Kombat 4.Some of the characters from previous Mortal Kombat games who returned in Mortal Kombat 3 were portrayed by new actors, since their original portrayers left Midway Games due to royalty disputes. Ho Sung Pak (Liu Kang in the first two games, as well as Shang Tsung in the first Mortal Kombat), Phillip Ahn (Shang Tsung in Mortal Kombat II), Elizabeth Malecki (Sonya Blade), and Katalin Zamiar (Kitana/Mileena/Jade) were not involved in the production of MK3.[1] Daniel Pesina (Johnny Cage and Scorpion/Sub-Zero/Reptile/Smoke/Noob Saibot) was also not involved in the production of MK3 as he had parted ways with Midway due to a lawsuit over royalties. He later appeared in an advertisement for BloodStorm, which resulted in a false rumor that it got him fired by Midway. All this led to the use of new actors for Liu Kang (Eddie Wong), Sonya Blade (Kerri Hoskins), Shang Tsung and Sub-Zero (both played by John Turk) in MK3. Carlos Pesina, who played Raiden in the first two games, did not appear in MK3 as a penalty for his involvement in the rival game Tattoo Assassins, but was still employed by Midway and his character would return in Mortal Kombat Trilogy, although through the use of recycled sprites from MKII and new sprites performed by Sal Divita.Accompanied by a massive promotional campaign (given the world record for the \"largest promotional campaign for a fighting video game\" in the 2011 Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition), Mortal Kombat 3 was originally released to the North American arcades on April 15, 1995. The game was soon ported to nearly all of the major home consoles available at the time of its release, including the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis, Super Nintendo Entertainment System and Sony PlayStation, but only the PlayStation version was identical to the arcade original, which was celebrated by Sony.[3]MK3 was originally slated to be released for the Atari Jaguar in the second quarter of 1996, according to a joint press release issued by Atari and Williams Entertainment on March 13, 1995,[4] but was never released. A port for the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer was also announced for an early 1996 release, touted on magazine covers, and reportedly complete, but was also never released.[5] A port for the Sega Saturn was also announced for early 1996,[6] but was cancelled in favor of a port of Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3.Mortal Kombat 3 is also included in Midway Arcade Treasures 2 for the Nintendo GameCube, PlayStation 2 and Xbox; Midway Arcade Treasures Deluxe Edition for the PC (this title includes a 'making of' documentary about the game); and Midway Arcade Treasures: Extended Play for the PlayStation Portable.Although Mortal Kombat 3 was commercially successful, many disliked the inclusion of arguably less-appealing new characters (especially Stryker) in place of established stalwarts such as Kitana or Scorpion.[2][7][8] The new combo system was also often criticized, as were, to a lesser degree, the run mechanics and some finishing moves.[9][10] According to PC Gamer in 1998, \"While Mortal Kombat 2 managed to improve upon the fast-paced, gore-galore formula of the original, the third incarnation didn’t fare nearly as well. MK3 suffered from monkeywrenched gameplay, needlessly stupid finishing moves like 'Animalities,' and unbearably campy character designs (remember the mall-cop with the enormous ass?).\"[11] A Retro Gamer article on the history of the series stated in 2007: \"Althrough many hardcore fans will decree Midway's third Mortal Kombat game to be the best in the series, just as many felt it was beginning of the end for the still massively popular franchise...While Midway had been constantly adding subtle gameplay tweaks to its franchise since the release of Mortal Kombat, its once exciting series was suddenly looking rather tired.\"[12]Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 (UMK3) was released to arcades in 1995. It is an update of Mortal Kombat 3, featuring altered gameplay, additional characters and new arenas. Various home versions of the game were released soon afterwards, although none of these were completely identical to the arcade version. Several more home versions followed between 2002-2010, including Mortal Kombat Advance for the Game Boy Advance and Ultimate Mortal Kombat for the Nintendo DS (the DS version features the \"Puzzle Kombat\" minigame originally from Mortal Kombat: Deception).","title":"Mortal Kombat 3","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/9e/Mortal_Kombat_3_cover.JPG/256px-Mortal_Kombat_3_cover.JPG","developer":"Midway Games","genre":"Fighting game"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_Bike_Rally","description":"Mountain Bike Rally is a Super Nintendo Entertainment System bicycle racing video game that is a simulation of real mountain biking.

(ミスタードゥ, Misutā Du?) is an arcade game created by Universal in 1982. Remotely similar in gameplay to Namco's popular Dig Dug title, Mr. Do! was also popular and saw release on a variety of home video game consoles and systems. It is the first game in the Mr. Do series, and was released both as a standalone game and as a conversion kit (released by Taito Corp.) for existing arcade cabinets. It was one of the first arcade games to be released as a conversion kit, and went on to sell 30,000 units in the United States.[1] It was remade in Japan as Neo Mr. Do! (ネオミスタードゥ, Neo Misutā Du?). It was also a popular choice on the 1983 video arcade-based game show Starcade.The object of Mr. Do! is to score as many points as possible by digging tunnels through the ground and collecting cherries. The title character, Mr. Do (a circus clown—except for the original Japanese version of the game in which he is a snowman. See flyer image at right of this text), is constantly chased by red monsters resembling small dinosaurs, and the player loses a life if Mr. Do is caught by one. The game is over when the last life is lost.Mr. Do!, like many games of its time, has been ported to a variety of computer systems and video game consoles, including the Atari 2600, several Atari 8-bit home computers, the ColecoVision, Apple II, MSX and the Commodore 64 series of computers. An accurate and colourful unofficial BBC Micro conversion, Mr. Ee!, was praised by reviewers.Mr. Do! was followed by three sequels: Mr. Do's Castle in 1983 (also known as Mr. Do vs. the Unicorns), Mr. Do's Wild Ride and Do! Run Run both in 1984.An expanded 99-level version of Mr. Do! was developed for the arcades by Electrocoin in 1989.[2]A completely new version of the game, Neo Mr. Do!, was developed by Visco and licensed by Universal for SNK's Neo Geo system in 1997.[3]A loose rebranded adaptation of the game was released for the Game Boy Color in 1999, titled Quest: Fantasy Challenge. It was developed by Imagineer, and published by Sunsoft.

It was first released for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in 1994[citation needed], then later released for the Sega Genesis and Game Boy in the same year[citation needed], then Sega Channel in 1995, followed by Game Boy Color in 1999, and Game Boy Advance remake in 2001.The player controls the one player character, Mr. Nutz an Anthropomorphic red squirrel wearing shoes, gloves and a cap through six themed levels. The end goal is to stop Mr. Blizzard, a yeti, who is the final boss and is trying to take over the world by using his magic powers to turn it into a mass of ice. The game shares similarities with other platformers of the same time, being that jumping is the main technique used in the game to navigate both fixed and moving platforms and defeat or avoid most enemies. Ammunition, in the form of nuts, can be collected and thrown at enemies.Ocean released in 1994 another game on the Amiga under the name Mr. Nutz: Hoppin' Mad. Developed by Neon Studios, it featured the same titular character but with different, faster and more wide-open gameplay, unrelated levels and enemies, another story, and a large overworld map instead of a linear path to follow in a mini-map. This game was also going to be released for the Sega Mega Drive in 1995 as Mr Nutz 2, but it got shelved. A playable build exists, leaked in the form of source code and compiled upon.Mr. Nutz can run, jump, swim in some levels and collect items. The character can jump on most enemies, strike them with his tail, or throw nuts he has collected at them to defeat them. Apart from bosses, most enemies can be killed with one strike. As with many games, contact with hazards and enemies that does not sufficiently defeat them results in losing one unit of health followed by a few seconds of invulnerability as the character sprite flashes. No version contains a time limit, the player may spend as long as they wish on each level, although some versions of the game will reward the player with bonus points for clearing a level quickly. Coins found along the way will not only give points and bonuses during gameplay, but the total amount of coins collected in a level will determine the player's completion bonus at the end of a level. Coins, health, and extra lives are often hidden throughout the levels.","title":"Mr. Nutz","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c0/Mr._Nutz_SMD_cover.PNG/220px-Mr._Nutz_SMD_cover.PNG","developer":"Ocean","genre":"Side-scrolling"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ms._Pac-Man","description":"Ms. Pac-Man (Japanese: ミズ・パックマン, Hepburn: Mizu Pakkuman?) is an arcade video game from the Golden Age. It was produced by Illinois-based Midway Manufacturing corporation, the North American licensee of Pac-Man. Ms. Pac-Man was released in North America January 13, 1982,[1] following 1980's Pac-Man, and became one of the most popular video games of all time. This popularity led to its adoption as an official title by Namco, the creator of Pac-Man. The game introduced a female protagonist, new maze designs, and several other improved gameplay changes over the original title. It became the most successful American-produced arcade game, selling 115,000 arcade cabinets.[2]The gameplay of Ms. Pac-Man is largely identical to that of the original Pac-Man. The player earns points by eating pellets and avoiding ghosts (contact with one causes Ms. Pac-Man to lose a life). Eating an energizer (or \"power pellet\") causes the ghosts to turn blue, allowing them to be eaten for extra points. Bonus fruits can be eaten for increasing point values, twice per round. As the rounds increase, the speed increases, and energizers generally lessen the extent of the ghosts' vulnerability, eventually stopping altogether.Ms. Pac-Man was originally conceived as an enhancement kit for Pac-Man called Crazy Otto, created by programmers employed at the General Computer Corporation (GCC).[4] While Crazy Otto was under development, GCC settled a lawsuit with Atari over their Missile Command conversion kit Super Missile Attack. Part of the settlement terms barred GCC from selling future conversion kits without consent from the original game manufacturer.Rather than scrapping Crazy Otto entirely, the programmers decided to show it to Midway, Namco's American distributor of Pac-Man. Midway had become impatient in waiting for Namco to release its next Pac-Man game (which would be Super Pac-Man), and were enthusiastic that such a game had come to their attention. They bought the rights to Crazy Otto, changed the sprites to fit the Pac-Man universe, renamed the game Ms. Pac-Man, and released it into arcades.[5]Shortly before release, Stan Jarocki of Midway stated that Ms. Pac-Man was conceived in response to the original Pac-Man being \"the first commercial videogame to involve large numbers of women as players\" and that it is \"our way of thanking all those lady arcaders who have played and enjoyed Pac-Man.\"[6] The game was later awarded the Certificate of Merit as runner-up for Coin-Op Game of the Year at the 1982 Arcade Awards held in January 1983.[7]After the game became wildly popular, Midway and GCC undertook a brief legal battle concerning royalties. The Killer List of Videogames notes that the game was accomplished without Namco's consent, causing both companies to eventually turn over the rights to Namco. Ms. Pac-Man was reportedly the first in a series of unauthorized sequels that eventually led to the termination of the licensing agreement between Namco and Midway.[4] GCC co-founder Doug Macrae has disputed stories that the game was manufactured without Namco's blessing, claiming that then-Namco president Masaya Nakamura had even provided feedback over character artwork during the game's development.[5]Ms. Pac-Man was later released on the third Namco Museum game; however, there is no mention of it in Namco's official archives (including the archives on all of the Namco Museum releases).In 2001, Namco released an arcade board featuring both Ms. Pac-Man and Galaga in honor of the 20th anniversary of both games with the subtitle \"20 Year Reunion / Class of 1981\". It also features Pac-Man as a hidden bonus game. The later 25th Anniversary Edition allows all three games to be selected at the main menu.[citation needed]Like many other games of its era, Ms. Pac-Man has been ported to many platforms.Reviewing the Game Gear version, GamePro commented \"If you loved the Pac-Man games, then you loved Ms. Pac-Man, and if you loved Ms. Pac-Man at the arcades, you'll love her here, too.\"[14]In 2009, Game Informer put Ms. Pac-Man 10th on their list of \"The Top 200 Games of All Time\", saying that it \"trumped [the original Pac-Man] in nearly every way\".[15] This is down one rank from Game Informer '​s previous best games of all time list.[16]","title":"Ms. Pac-Man","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/Mspacmancabinet.png/256px-Mspacmancabinet.png","developer":"Bally Midway","genre":"Maze"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musya","description":"","title":"[hide]","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/17/Musya_Cover.jpg/250px-Musya_Cover.jpg","developer":"Jorudan","genre":"Action"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natsume_Championship_Wrestling","description":"Natsume Championship Wrestling is a 1994 Super Nintendo Entertainment System video game that was released in North America.","title":"Natsume Championship Wrestling","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/d9/Natsume_Championship_Wrestling.jpg/220px-Natsume_Championship_Wrestling.jpg","developer":"Natsume","genre":"Action"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Challenge","description":"NBA All-Star Challenge (ＮＢＡオールスターチャレンジ?) is a video game for the Super NES, the Game Boy and the Sega Genesis.The Dutch video game magazine Power Unlimited gave NBA All-Star Challenge an 80% rating in its January 1994 issue while the website Sega-16 gave the Sega Genesis version of the game a 20% rating on April 30, 2009.[2]A sequel, NBA All-Star Challenge 2, was released in December 1993 exclusively for the Game Boy.

It is the first entry in the NBA Jam series. The main designer and programmer for this game was Mark Turmell. Midway had previously released such sports games as Arch Rivals in 1989, High Impact in 1990, and Super High Impact in 1991. The gameplay of NBA Jam is based on Arch Rivals, another 2-on-2 basketball video game. However, it was the release of NBA Jam that brought mainstream success to the genre.The game became exceptionally popular, and generated a significant amount of money for arcades after its release, creating revenue of $1 billion in quarters.[1] In early 1994, the Amusement & Music Operators Association reported that NBA Jam had become the highest-earning arcade game of all time.[2]The release of NBA Jam gave rise to a new genre of sports games which were based around fast, action-packed gameplay and exaggerated realism, a formula which Midway would also later apply to the sports of football (NFL Blitz), and hockey (2 on 2 Open Ice Challenge).NBA Jam, which featured 2-on-2 basketball, is one of the first real playable basketball arcade games, and is also one of the first sports games to feature NBA-licensed teams and players, and their real digitized likenesses.A key feature of NBA Jam is the exaggerated nature of the play - players jump many times their own height, making slam dunks that defy both human capabilities and the laws of physics.[3] There are no fouls, free throws, or violations except goaltending and 24-second violations.[3] This means the player is able to freely shove or elbow his opponent out of the way. Additionally, if a player makes three baskets in a row, he becomes \"on fire\" and has unlimited turbo and increased shooting precision.[3] The \"on fire\" mode continues until the other team scores, or until the player who is \"on fire\" scores 4 additional consecutive baskets while \"on fire.\"The original arcade version of NBA Jam features team rosters from the 1992-93 NBA season and the console versions use rosters from the 1993-94 NBA season. More up-to-date rosters were available in subsequent ports released for the Sega CD, Game Boy, and Game Gear in 1994. Midway did not secure the license to use Michael Jordan's name or likeness (as Jordan himself owns the rights to his name and likeness, and not the NBA), and as such he was not available as a player for the Chicago Bulls or any other team. Another notable absence from the home versions is Shaquille O'Neal, who was in the arcade version as a member of the Orlando Magic. New Jersey Nets guard Dražen Petrović and Boston Celtics forward Reggie Lewis, both of whom died after the release of the arcade version, were also removed from the home versions.Note: Some home console versions of NBA Jam were coded later than others, and as a result of real-life roster changes or in the cases of Charles Barkley and Shaquille O'Neal, legal reasons, some rosters differ from version to version.1Dražen Petrović was killed in a car crash between the release of the arcade version and the home ports. NBA Jam is said to be haunted by Petrović, due to a bug causing his last name to be randomly called out by the announcer.[5]An update named NBA Jam Tournament Edition (commonly referred to as NBA Jam T.E.) featured updated rosters, new features and easter eggs combined with the same gameplay of the original. Jon Hey created new music specifically for NBA Jam T.E. to replace the original NBA Jam music. Teams now consisted of three players (with the exception of the new \"Rookies\" team, which consists of five players, all picked in the 1994 NBA Draft) and players could be substituted into the game at half time. The game also featured new hidden teams and hidden playable characters. Early versions of the game included characters from Midway's Mortal Kombat games. Players were also assigned more attributes, including clutch and fatigue levels. In addition, the game also introduced features such as a \"Tournament\" mode that turned off computer assistance and on-court hot spots that allowed for additional points or special slam dunks.The test version of NBA Jam Tournament Edition included six hidden characters which were taken out of the final version at the request of the NBA: Elviscious, Grim Reaper, Kong, Raiden, Reptile, and Sub-Zero. Midway also stated they would update all test version cabinets to remove these characters.[7]The NBA Jam games were ported to many home video game consoles as well as PC, beginning with the original's debut on the highly publicized Jam Day (March 4, 1994). Console versions were well known for featuring many new secret characters; the home versions of Jam T.E. even allowed the player to use then President Bill Clinton, First Lady Hillary Clinton, Vice President Al Gore and Atari's Vice President of Software Development Leonard Tramiel on the Atari Jaguar version. Acclaim published the console versions and later ended up winning the exclusive rights to use the NBA Jam name.Acclaim used the name on NBA Jam Extreme in 1996, a 3D version of Jam which featured Marv Albert doing commentary. The game was a flop in comparison to Midway's version released that same year, rechristened NBA Hangtime. Hangtime added a create-a-player option to the usual batch of new features combined with classic, but refined NBA Jam gameplay. An update called NBA Maximum Hangtime was subsequently released.In 1995, Acclaim released a collegiate version of NBA Jam for home consoles entitled College Slam. Although the game was created to capitalize on the popularity of March Madness and the subsequent Final Four, it did not enjoy the popularity of the earlier NBA Jam games.However, the idea was not quite dead as Midway passed it to their other sports games. This included the hockey games 2 on 2 Open Ice Challenge and Wayne Gretzky's 3D Hockey, as well as NFL Blitz and WWF Wrestlemania: The Arcade Game. Midway produced successors to the series with 3-D graphics, NBA Showtime: NBA on NBC and NBA Hoopz. Acclaim continued to keep the NBA Jam name alive with its console games, although the games were only mildly popular.On October 5, 2010, EA Sports released a new version of NBA Jam for the Wii. The game was later ported to the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in November 2010. Original NBA Jam creator Mark Turmell was hired to work on this new version in conjunction with EA Vancouver.[8] Following the game's critical and commercial success, a follow-up, NBA Jam: On Fire Edition was released on October 4, 2011 on PSN and XBLA on October 5, 2011.In popular sports culture, the phrases \"He's heating up\", \"He's on fire\" and \"Boomshakalaka!\" are identified with NBA Jam. In the game these catch-phrases describe when a player hit two or three shots in a row. When a player is \"on fire\", the ball literally catches fire and singes the net. Voiced by Tim Kitzrow, the announcer is reminiscent of Marv Albert and has contributed numerous memorable lines to the basketball lexicon.[17] The NBA Jam script was written solely by Jon Hey.NBA Jam also incorporated a slogan from Spike Lee's alter-ego in his 1986 film She's Gotta Have It, Mars Blackmon, who was also featured in a Nike basketball shoe television commercial at the time. The NBA Jam commentator asked, \"Is it the shoes?\" after a player performed spectacularly.The upbeat, funky music written by Jon Hey was inspired by sports music themes and has been compared to George Clinton's P-Funk All Stars. Funkadelic's 1979 \"(Not Just) Knee Deep\" shares the most similarity with the music of NBA Jam but was recorded more than a decade before NBA Jam '​s music was written. The likeness of George Clinton was used as the character \"P. Funk\" in the console versions of NBA Jam: Tournament Edition. The original NBA Jam arcade release and the NBA Jam T. E. arcade release had different music for the title screen and for each quarter.In July 2009, Mortal Kombat creator Ed Boon revealed (on Twitter) that a Mortal Kombat court was to be hidden in a console port of NBA Jam or NBA Hangtime.[18]","title":"NBA Jam","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a0/Nbajam.jpg/220px-Nbajam.jpg","developer":"Midway","genre":"Sports"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Jam_Tournament_Edition","description":"NBA Jam is a basketball arcade game published and developed by Midway in 1993.

New Jersey Nets guard Dražen Petrović and Boston Celtics forward Reggie Lewis, both of whom died after the release of the arcade version, were also removed from the home versions.Note: Some home console versions of NBA Jam were coded later than others, and as a result of real-life roster changes or in the cases of Charles Barkley and Shaquille O'Neal, legal reasons, some rosters differ from version to version.1Dražen Petrović was killed in a car crash between the release of the arcade version and the home ports. NBA Jam is said to be haunted by Petrović, due to a bug causing his last name to be randomly called out by the announcer.[5]An update named NBA Jam Tournament Edition (commonly referred to as NBA Jam T.E.) featured updated rosters, new features and easter eggs combined with the same gameplay of the original. Jon Hey created new music specifically for NBA Jam T.E. to replace the original NBA Jam music. Teams now consisted of three players (with the exception of the new \"Rookies\" team, which consists of five players, all picked in the 1994 NBA Draft) and players could be substituted into the game at half time. The game also featured new hidden teams and hidden playable characters. Early versions of the game included characters from Midway's Mortal Kombat games. Players were also assigned more attributes, including clutch and fatigue levels. In addition, the game also introduced features such as a \"Tournament\" mode that turned off computer assistance and on-court hot spots that allowed for additional points or special slam dunks.The test version of NBA Jam Tournament Edition included six hidden characters which were taken out of the final version at the request of the NBA: Elviscious, Grim Reaper, Kong, Raiden, Reptile, and Sub-Zero. Midway also stated they would update all test version cabinets to remove these characters.[7]The NBA Jam games were ported to many home video game consoles as well as PC, beginning with the original's debut on the highly publicized Jam Day (March 4, 1994). Console versions were well known for featuring many new secret characters; the home versions of Jam T.E. even allowed the player to use then President Bill Clinton, First Lady Hillary Clinton, Vice President Al Gore and Atari's Vice President of Software Development Leonard Tramiel on the Atari Jaguar version. Acclaim published the console versions and later ended up winning the exclusive rights to use the NBA Jam name.Acclaim used the name on NBA Jam Extreme in 1996, a 3D version of Jam which featured Marv Albert doing commentary. The game was a flop in comparison to Midway's version released that same year, rechristened NBA Hangtime. Hangtime added a create-a-player option to the usual batch of new features combined with classic, but refined NBA Jam gameplay. An update called NBA Maximum Hangtime was subsequently released.In 1995, Acclaim released a collegiate version of NBA Jam for home consoles entitled College Slam. Although the game was created to capitalize on the popularity of March Madness and the subsequent Final Four, it did not enjoy the popularity of the earlier NBA Jam games.However, the idea was not quite dead as Midway passed it to their other sports games. This included the hockey games 2 on 2 Open Ice Challenge and Wayne Gretzky's 3D Hockey, as well as NFL Blitz and WWF Wrestlemania: The Arcade Game. Midway produced successors to the series with 3-D graphics, NBA Showtime: NBA on NBC and NBA Hoopz. Acclaim continued to keep the NBA Jam name alive with its console games, although the games were only mildly popular.On October 5, 2010, EA Sports released a new version of NBA Jam for the Wii. The game was later ported to the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in November 2010. Original NBA Jam creator Mark Turmell was hired to work on this new version in conjunction with EA Vancouver.[8] Following the game's critical and commercial success, a follow-up, NBA Jam: On Fire Edition was released on October 4, 2011 on PSN and XBLA on October 5, 2011.In popular sports culture, the phrases \"He's heating up\", \"He's on fire\" and \"Boomshakalaka!\" are identified with NBA Jam. In the game these catch-phrases describe when a player hit two or three shots in a row. When a player is \"on fire\", the ball literally catches fire and singes the net. Voiced by Tim Kitzrow, the announcer is reminiscent of Marv Albert and has contributed numerous memorable lines to the basketball lexicon.[17] The NBA Jam script was written solely by Jon Hey.NBA Jam also incorporated a slogan from Spike Lee's alter-ego in his 1986 film She's Gotta Have It, Mars Blackmon, who was also featured in a Nike basketball shoe television commercial at the time. The NBA Jam commentator asked, \"Is it the shoes?\" after a player performed spectacularly.The upbeat, funky music written by Jon Hey was inspired by sports music themes and has been compared to George Clinton's P-Funk All Stars. Funkadelic's 1979 \"(Not Just) Knee Deep\" shares the most similarity with the music of NBA Jam but was recorded more than a decade before NBA Jam '​s music was written. The likeness of George Clinton was used as the character \"P. Funk\" in the console versions of NBA Jam: Tournament Edition. The original NBA Jam arcade release and the NBA Jam T. E. arcade release had different music for the title screen and for each quarter.In July 2009, Mortal Kombat creator Ed Boon revealed (on Twitter) that a Mortal Kombat court was to be hidden in a console port of NBA Jam or NBA Hangtime.[18]","title":"NBA Jam","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a0/Nbajam.jpg/220px-Nbajam.jpg","developer":"Midway","genre":"Sports"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Live_95","description":"NBA Live 95 is the first of the NBA Live video games series.

The following year, Acclaim and LJN released a new multiplatform title under the same name, adding options to play full team games under NFL rules, while retaining the Quarterback Challenge mode. The game was released for the SNES, Sega Genesis and Game Gear. A Game Boy version, called NFL Quarterback Club II and a 32x version were released in 1995. Both these versions omitted the Quarterback Challenge mode, a trend that would continue with NFL Quarterback Club 96.In 1994, NFL Quarterback Club was released for the SNES. The main appeal about the game is that it offers three different types of modes to play in, making it more like three games in one. Up to four different players can play at the same time.The Game Boy version, also known as NFL Quarterback Club 95, simulated the NFL Quarterback Challenge and featured 13 quarterbacks, including Troy Aikman, Warren Moon, Jim Kelly and John Elway.

Other gameplay improvements include fake shots, drop passes and lying on the ice to block shots. Fighting is still removed but if a player sustained a multi game injury during season play, the player would be shown lying on the ice with nasty leg injury, if it was during exhibition game the player would have stars around his head.

The series was broadcast by the cable television network Nickelodeon from 1992 to 1995. The show features young athletes competing in various athletic events in the \"Extreme Arena\", a set built on Sound Stage 21 at Universal Studios Florida. Guts reruns were shown on Nickelodeon from January 15, 1996 until February 28, 1999 before moving to Nickelodeon GAS from March 1, 1999 until the network's closure on December 31, 2007 (April 23, 2009 on Dish Network). It has occasionally been seen in reruns on TeenNick since January 1, 2008.In 2008, Nickelodeon produced two seasons of a revival of the program, My Family's Got Guts.On each half-hour episode, three children or teenagers, individually represented by blue, red, and purple compete against each other in four events that are based on skills in popular sports, such as basketball, baseball, football, and soccer. While most of these events include the use of an elastic harness, others make use of a wave pool, and sometimes a racing track is used. During the show's run, more creative and ambitious events were invented, even including a fabricated ski slope. Contestants earn points to their total score at the end of each event based on their performance. First place in each event is worth 300 points. Second place receives 200 points, and third place earns 100 points.After each event, one of the three players is asked to \"Spill Your Guts\", between the remaining events. In season one, Mike talks about the player and his and her athletic and non-athletic interests. In season two, Moira discusses the player's interests, and also mentions what \"guts\" equaled to that player. In season three, during a brief prerecorded segment, players introduce themselves and reveal their athletic and non-athletic interests, what \"having guts\" means to them, why they are excited to be on the show, and/or usually also give a shout-out to their friends and family back home. On Global Guts, it retains the prerecorded segment for players, contestants introduce themselves; non-English speakers introduce themselves in their native language, and a translator does an English voice over for them.There are several different types of events, ranging from field sports to the pool. Many aerial events made use of elastic harnesses.The fifth and final event of the show would pit the three contestants in a race to climb a fabricated mountain called the Aggro Crag (season 1-2), and later called the Mega Crag (season 3), and the Super Aggro Crag (Global GUTS). The object of the Crag was for all three contestants to race to the peak of the Crag, while activating a series of lighted targets commonly referred to as \"actuators\" along the way to the peak. If a contestant misses any actuators along the way, a spotter at the top (often referred to on-air as the \"crag troll\") would prevent that player from completing the climb until he/she returned and activates whatever targets they missed. The climb is made more difficult with special effects that simulated lightning storms in the form of strobe lights, rock avalanches, flying \"snow\" in the form of glitter and confetti, \"nuclear flying crystals\", and steep walls. Each contestant had a separate, but identical, side of the mountain to climb, and was not permitted to cross into their opponents' paths or disrupt their progress. The first contestant to successfully activate each target, including the final one at the peak of the mountain, earns first-place worth 725 points. The second and third-place contestants earned 550 and 375 points, respectively.A number of violations/errors on the Crag could result in a player automatically receiving third place points. These include:The increased point structure in the event allows contestants to come from behind to win, despite earlier mistakes. It also nearly ensures that no two contestants could achieve a tie score. The only way two contestants could tie on the Crag is if they both violate the rules as outlined above. Although theoretically possible, a tie in the contestants' total scores never happened, even when two contestants were disqualified on the Aggro Crag.The Aggro Crag went through several revisions in the show's run, each longer and more difficult than the previous version. In the first two taped seasons (1992 and 1993), the mountain was called the Aggro Crag. For the show's third season in 1994, the mountain was renamed the Mega Crag. For the show's final season, Global Guts (1995), it changed yet again to the Super Aggro Crag. In the third season in 1994, its color was changed to be molten. Sound Design for the action on the Aggro Crag was created by Nickelodeon Senior Sound Designer Mark Schultz, who converted the voltages supplied by the infrared actuator \"eyes\" to triggers read by a MIDI-based sampler.The total height of the Aggro Crag is 28 feet. For Global Guts, the Super Aggro Crag was 30 feet tall.[1]The player with the most points after all five events wins the game and receives a gold Guts medal, as well as a faux glowing piece of the Aggro Crag. When the show changed to Global Guts, the medals were redesigned to reflect the show's new logo. With all seasons of the show, second place receives a silver medal and third receives a bronze medal. The highest possible score for a player is 1925 points, and was attained several times throughout the show's run. Three contestants who achieved this score in 1992 were invited back to compete in a one-hour Guts All-Star Special in 1993.For the show's final season, Nickelodeon produced an international spinoff, Global Guts, featuring contestants from various countries, including the United States of America, Mexico, United Kingdom, Israel, Germany, Spain, Portugal, and the Commonwealth of Independent States (simply referred to as \"CIS\" on air, this included only Georgia, Kazakhstan, Russia, and Ukraine). Although the countries had multiple contestants, no country was ever represented twice in a single episode except for the Special Olympic special where it had 2 U.S. players. Each country had its own team of broadcasters; O'Malley retained this role for the US broadcast. The format remained identical to the original version, but the Mega Crag was upgraded to the Super Aggro Crag. In the \"Spill Your Guts\" segments, for players from non-English-speaking countries, an interpreter was used.Taping of Global Guts took place from July 12 to August 15, 1995, and episodes began airing September 5, 1995.[2]which was part of Nick in the Afternoon.Medal presentations were also accompanied by the raising of flags and the playing of the national anthem of the winning country, and a victory lap by the contestants, draped in the flags of their home countries. A medal count was also tabulated at the beginning of each episode, similar to the Olympics.In addition to airing the program on Nickelodeon in the United States, it aired on the Ukrainian Television Network in the CIS, Nickelodeon in Germany, the Israeli Children's Channel in Israel, MVS Multivisión in Mexico, SIC in Portugal, TVE in Spain, and Nickelodeon UK in the United Kingdom.As a precursor to Global Guts, season 3 of Guts featured six contestants from the United Kingdom, competing in six separate shows. Of the six, four contestants ended up winning the gold medal. The six UK contestants were as follows:In 1992, Backstreet Boy A.J. McLean appeared on Guts, competing against Amanda \"The Accelerator\" Bulger and Jamie \"The Jackal\" Mendelsohn, and finished with the silver medal, losing to Jamie \"The Jackal\" Mendelsohn, the \"Jack of All Sports\". He was in blue and referred to on the show as AJ \"Mean\" McLean. He had one event win during his appearance, that being a win in the Slam Dunk event.In 1993, Hollywood stuntwoman Anna Mercedes Morris competed on the show under the name Anna \"Roadrunner\" Morris. She was dressed in red, competing against \"Lawless\" Lauren Shealy and Paul \"Running Man\" Battson, and she finished with the gold medal, despite injuring her knee in the Basic Training event.In 1993, actor Mike Vogel competed on Guts with Christy \"Blast\" Gast and Cam \"The Ice Man\" Burke, and finished with the silver medal. He tied with the other players for first place on Over the Top and also won the Aggro Crag event, coming from third place to take second overall. He was known as Mike \"Flea\" Vogel and was dressed in blue.In 1994, actress Ashley Drane competed on Guts with Nicole \"The Bomber\" Bozard and UK resident Leanne \"Panther\" Kelley, and finished with the silver medal. She was known as Ashley \"The Face\" Drane and was dressed in blue. Exactly 10 years later, Ashley made a 2nd Nickelodeon appearance, this time on Drake and Josh playing Drake's girlfriend Susan in the episode \"Believe Me Brother\". Mike \"The Dominator\" Drane, a Guts player from season 1, is also her brother.In 1994, D. C. United defender Bobby Boswell appeared on Guts, competing against Robin \"The Lizard\" Rexroat and Jennifer \"The Jaguar\" Barnes, and finished with the silver medal. He was known on the show as Bobby \"Lightning\" Boswell and won the soccer event \"Shoot Out\", just a hint of what was to come for his career. Boswell, who was dressed in purple, also won the Mega Crag event in that very same show.In 1995, Bring It On the Musical star Gregory Haney appeared on Global Guts as Greg \"Big Dog\" Haney, playing for team USA. He wore blue and played against Thomas \"The Typhoon\" Rosen from Germany, and Mor \"The Twister\" Kesar from Israel. Haney won four out of five events, including the Super Aggro Crag, which increased his score high enough for him to win the gold medal.The following were guests during the 1992 season:The following were guests during the 1994 season:The guests in the 1994 season would, before each event, give a list of three \"Smart Moves\" (suggestions) that they felt that the players should follow.All of the episodes of Guts exist, and have aired on Nickelodeon until 1999, the now defunct Nick GaS from 1999 to 2007. Guts was also on the list of programs to be included on The '90s Are All That (TeenNick's 1990s block) upon its launch in July 2011, but the program did not make its debut until August 2013.A revival of the show, My Family's Got Guts, debuted on September 15, 2008, filmed at Universal Studios Florida as was the original (but due to it already being occupied, not on the same sound stage as the original). This version is hosted by Ben Lyons, along with Australian celebrity Asha Kuerten as the referee. Unlike the original, it follows a bracket tournament format featuring 2 families competing as teams per episode, with points earned being used instead to provide a head start during the Aggro Crag rather than deciding the winner.In November 1994 Nickelodeon released a video game based on the Guts game show for the Super Nintendo. One or two players may compete in many of the events that debuted in the TV show, including the Aggro Crag. The game is based on the actual footage of the show and contains filmed contestants.[3]","title":"","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/ab/Nickelodeon_GUTS.svg/200px-Nickelodeon_GUTS.svg.png","developer":"","genre":""},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigel_Mansell%27s_World_Championship_Racing","description":"","title":"Nigel Mansell's World Championship Racing\nNigel Mansell's F-1 Challenge","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/93/Nigel_Mansell%27s_World_Championship_Racing_Cover.jpg/220px-Nigel_Mansell%27s_World_Championship_Racing_Cover.jpg","developer":"Gremlin Graphics","genre":"Racing"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninja_Gaiden_Trilogy","description":"Ninja Gaiden (NINJA 外伝?) is a series of video games by Tecmo featuring the ninja Ryu Hayabusa as its protagonist. The series was originally known as Ninja Ryukenden (忍者龍剣伝, Ninja Ryūkenden?, lit. \"Legend of the Ninja Dragon Sword\") in Japan. The word \"gaiden\" in the North American Ninja Gaiden title means \"side-story\" in Japanese, even though the Ninja Gaiden series is not a spinoff of a previous series. The original arcade version, first two NES games and Game Boy game were released as Shadow Warriors in PAL regions.The series gained popularity on the 8-bit Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) for its tight action-platform gameplay, catchy music and, according to G4's X-Play, for being the first console game to have the story presented in cinematic cutscenes. The 8-bit trilogy was enhanced for the 16-bit Super NES in 1995. Sega also released two Ninja Gaiden games for the Game Gear and Master System, the latter only for PAL regions. A new game, titled Ninja Gaiden, was released in 2004 as a 3D action game on the Xbox, developed by Team Ninja, the makers of Dead or Alive.[1] The Ninja Gaiden franchise is well known for its high degree of difficulty, particularly the original NES version and the Xbox revival.[2]The arcade version of Ninja Gaiden (released in 1988, in Japan, North America, and Europe)[3] was a Double Dragon-style beat 'em up, in which the player controls a nameless blue ninja as he travels to various regions of the United States (such as San Francisco, New York City and Las Vegas) to defeat an evil cult led by a fictional descendant of Nostradamus, who is trying to personally fulfil his ancestor's prophecy of the rise of an evil king in 1999. The player has a variety of techniques, such as a flying neck throw and a back-flip.[4] The player can obtain power-ups by throwing enemies into background objects, such as street lights and dumpsters. The player fights primarily with his bare hands, although a sword can also be used for a limited time as a power-up; he can also use environmental objects as a prop from which he can deliver more powerful kicking attacks. Although the game takes place in different environments, there are primarily only five kinds of enemies, all of which appear in every level (although some levels have extra enemy types). The game is remembered for its infamous continue screen (where the player character is tied to the ground underneath a descending circular saw).[5]The original Ninja Gaiden arcade game received several ports for the Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64, Commodore Amiga and ZX Spectrum computers. The Amiga version in particular, retained almost all of the graphics and functionality of the original game, including the two-player cooperative gameplay and the introduction. All these versions, developed by Ocean Software, were only released in Europe as Shadow Warriors. A PC (MS-DOS format) port of the original Ninja Gaiden was also developed by Hi Tech Expressions, this time for its release in North America as Ninja Gaiden, as opposed to the other computer versions. However, it featured stripped down play mechanics and a low 16 colour palette.Lastly, was ported to the Atari Lynx handheld system. The original title was a solid port of the arcade title and is a more sought-after title for the Lynx.An emulated version of the arcade game exists in the Xbox version's update, Ninja Gaiden Black, as a bonus feature, and it is also available through Nintendo's Wii Virtual Console download service.The first Ninja Gaiden for the Nintendo Entertainment System was released in Japan on December 9, 1988, in the United States on March 1989, and in Europe on August 15, 1991. A ninja named Ryu Hayabusa finds a letter by his recently missing father, Ken, telling him to go to America and meet with an archaeologist Dr. Smith. Dr. Smith tells Ryu that two statues hidden by Ryu's father and the doctor have the power to end the world – if united. Ryu ends up in South America and battles Jaquio, an evil cult leader bent on reviving the ancient demon called \"Jashin\" and responsible for the attack on Ken Hayabusa.While the arcade game itself bears little or no connection to the later NES trilogy or Xbox revival (although the Xbox version does feature the same flying neck throw from the arcade game), certain aspects of it were carried over to the first NES title. The first stage in the NES game is a loose adaptation of the first stage in the arcade game and the opening cutscene in the NES game vaguely resembles the intro in the arcade version. Both games also feature Jason Voorhees look-alikes and the final boss in the arcade game vaguely resembles Bloody Malth from the NES game. The game introduced many of the series' staples, including the cinematic cutscenes, the boomerang-like Windmill Shuriken and the magical techniques called Ninja Arts (or Ninpo). Like all games in the series, it is noted for its difficulty, particularly the infamous Stage 6–2. To use the ninja arts, users had to collect power-ups. Each art used up a certain number of power-ups.There are also several other versions of the Ninja Gaiden games on other platforms. A port of the first NES Ninja Gaiden was developed by Hudson for the PC Engine and released only in Japan, although the game features an unlockable English mode (with a different translation than the NES game). Other differences include enhanced graphics, reworked music and rebalanced difficulty.In the sequel, Ninja Gaiden II: The Dark Sword of Chaos, Ryu learns of a new villain named Ashtar, Emperor of Chaos and master to Jaquio. Ryu must rescue Irene Lew, a former CIA agent, from Ashtar and destroy the Dark Sword, a weapon of great power, forged from a bone of the demon, as the Dragon Sword is forged from a fang of a dragon. In the end, Ryu learns that Jaquio has been reborn to fulfil the destiny of Ashtar and the Dark Sword. This game was the first to feature Spirit Clones, invincible copies of Ryu which would mimic his movements and fight by his side. Also introduced was the ability to scale walls without the need to constantly jump upwards.Ninja Gaiden II: The Dark Sword of Chaos received computer ports developed by GameTek for the PC (MS-DOS format) and the Commodore Amiga, both for their release in North America. They featured a 256 colour palette (32 on Amiga) and were translated faithfully (though animation and movement were choppier) and also offered a save-and-load function, where your exact position in the game could be saved at any given moment.The third game, titled Ninja Gaiden III: The Ancient Ship of Doom, has what some[who?] considered to be a rather convoluted and, at times, contradictory story featuring rogue secret agents, genetic engineering and the eponymous warship. The gameplay is largely unchanged and more is revealed about Foster, the CIA agent who sent Ryu after Jaquio in the first game and his true intentions towards the ninja. This game is often considered to be the most difficult of the original trilogy, as continues are limited this time. Additionally, most attacks deal 2 damage units to the player (rather than 1 in the previous games), who still has only 16 health units. New innovations in the third installment included a sword extension power-up that increased the range of the player's attack until the end of the level or until death, new types of surfaces from which the player could hang, and automatically scrolling areas.It was both ported to the Atari Lynx handheld system. It was a very-faithful port of the NES game and is virtually identical from beginning to end, albeit with a more distorted-sounding soundtrack and slightly-jumbled visuals due to the lower in-game video resolution. An LCD handheld version produced by Tiger Electronics was released in 1988, which also had a sequel.Ninja Gaiden Trilogy (忍者龍剣伝 巴, Ninja Ryūkenden Tomoe?) is a 1995 SNES collection featuring all three games. Few improvements were made, but passwords were included and the cinematic sequences were improved. The graphics were retouched and the soundtrack was updated. The third game was also made more playable by reverting the difficulty level to that of the Japanese version, with infinite continues and more reasonable damage from enemy attacks. Unfortunately, the ports suffered from slowdown, unresponsive controls, finicky hit detection, and no closing credits. Some graphical changes were made that removed parallax scrolling from the backgrounds of the levels. Other graphical changes were made to comply with Nintendo's \"Family Friendly\" censorship policy at the time (i.e. a pool of blood changed from red to green, and the removal of pentagrams). Fans also complained about the omission of some music tracks (including removing two pieces of music from Ninja Gaiden III and replacing the use of the stage 1–1 music in the Ninja Gaiden II pursuit cutscenes with a repeating footstep sound). Conversely, a degree of censorship was actually removed from certain parts of the script (for example, Jaquio's \"Argh! He's awake\" is replaced with \"Damn, he's awake.\"), though the retooled scripts also featured new typographical errors not found in the original translations.[citation needed] Despite these shortcomings, Ninja Gaiden Trilogy is a bit of a collector's item and sells for nearly $200 if still sealed.[6]Ninja Gaiden Trilogy was included as a bonus unlockable in 2004's Ninja Gaiden for the Xbox.Tecmo released a Game Boy version called Ninja Gaiden Shadow. It was actually a licensed edit of a proposed Shadow of the Ninja (Natsume) Game Boy port. Although it was released following the NES trilogy, the game is actually a prequel to the original game.Sega, under license from Tecmo, developed three games but ultimately released only two: one for the Master System and another for the Game Gear, both bearing the Ninja Gaiden title worldwide, marking the first time a game in the series was released with the Ninja Gaiden name in Japan and Europe.Released in Europe, Australia and Brazil in 1992 for the Master System, this game has similar gameplay mechanics to the NES games, though it had much better graphics, faster gameplay and a few changes were made such as Ryu bouncing off walls instead of clinging to them, like the later 3D games. The game featured a new storyline, characters and scenarios, not connected to any of the other Ninja Gaiden games.Released in Japan, North America and Europe in 1991 for the Game Gear, this game was not very close to any of the other Ninja Gaiden games. It featured a smaller screen size, bigger character sprites, slower game speed, and unlike the NES and Master System games which were more oriented to platforming action, this was more a linear side-scrolling game in the likes of the Shinobi series.A Mega Drive/Genesis version of Ninja Gaiden'[7] was in development by Sega sometime in 1992. It was planned to be a belt scroll-style beat-'em-up similar to the arcade version of Ninja Gaiden, instead of following the side-scrolling platform game format from the NES trilogy. The plot would have involved Ryu traveling to the United States in order to track down a pair of sibling ninjas named Jin and Rika who have gone rogue by stealing the Secret Scrolls of the Huma (an alternate romanization of the name \"Fūma\"). The Mega Drive version is not a port of the arcade game, but some of the stages (such as a casino) and enemy characters (like the hockey mask-wearing punks) are similar,[8] though the play mechanics are very different.The game was never released commercially, but a beta build was leaked through the internet as a ROM image. The beta features seven stages, including cut-scenes and bosses, but has several programming bugs such as odd moving controls, unfinished levels, and cut-scenes which are skipped before finishing. Although the opening and stage names are in Japanese, the rest of the cut-scenes were translated into English. The techniques available in the beta consist of a standard punch combo, a jump kick, a rolling move, a special somersault kick, and a throw.The story of the 2004 release of Ninja Gaiden and its sequels have been established as a prequel, taking place before the original NES trilogy.[9][10][11] The main story of the game involves Ryu Hayabusa setting out on a quest to retrieve the Dark Dragon Blade from the hands of evil after most of his clan was wiped out.The series was revived after several years with the 2004 release of Ninja Gaiden for the Xbox. The title was developed over five years by developer Tomonobu Itagaki and his Team Ninja, and eventually released to high sales and critical acclaim. An upgraded edition with new content, modes and features came out the following year under the name Ninja Gaiden Black.Later, a enhanced port directed by Yosuke Hayashi was made for the PlayStation 3 as Ninja Gaiden Sigma, released on July 3, 2007. This version has its graphics reworked to high definition standards, and Rachel as a playable character. In 2012, updated version of the Sigma game was a launch title for the PlayStation Vita, titled Ninja Gaiden Sigma Plus. It added a few new costumes for the playable characters, touch controls and making ninpo attacks stronger, and a new trophy list for the game.Ninja Gaiden: Dragon Sword was released in March 2008, only for the Nintendo DS. The game is played in a diagonal top-down view with 3D graphics, and the player needs to hold the Nintendo DS sideways, like a book, as in Hotel Dusk: Room 215 and Brain Age: Train Your Brain in Minutes a Day!. Ninja Gaiden: Dragon Sword is played using full potential of the stylus. The story is set six months after the event of 2004's Ninja Gaiden. There is also a new playable female ninja character, Momiji.[12]Ninja Gaiden II was a follow up to the series, released in 2008 and published by Microsoft Game Studios for the Xbox 360. It is set one year after the events in Ninja Gaiden (2004). The new features in the game were four difficulty levels, a regenerating health bar, and upgraded graphics and enemy AI.[13]An enhanced version of Ninja Gaiden II was released for the PlayStation 3, titled Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2.[14] The PlayStation Vita version, titled Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2 Plus, was released in 2013.Although series director Tomonobu Itagaki left shortly after the release of Ninja Gaiden II, Tecmo Koei still owned the franchise and planned to instigate development of another title, with a newly restructured Team Ninja. This title was revealed as Ninja Gaiden III at the Tokyo Game Show 2010. Information about the game in the coming months revealed that the new director, Yosuke Hayashi, would be taking the series to new directions, including the addition of \"resistance\" in cutting through enemies. Later, at the E3 2011, the game was unvelied as Ninja Gaiden 3. Changes to gameplay included removing dismemberment, replacing the roll with a new \"slide\" maneuver, and a \"kunai climb\" technique that would allow Ryu to scale certain walls. Tecmo Koei released the game on March 20, 2012 for both the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.An expanded version of the game titled Ninja Gaiden 3: Razor's Edge was released later on November 18th of the same year for the Wii U. In early 2013, Razor's Edge was released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 as well.Ryu, voiced by Keiichi Nanba, is the main character in the 1991 OVA film Ninja Ryūkenden, released in Japan only. Ryu Hayabusa has a unique look in the animation.[citation needed]Some of the Ninja Gaiden series have received novelizations, such as the NES version.[citation needed]Ninja Gaiden's characters, as well as other references to the series, can be found in cameos and additional items in various titles from games by Tecmo, Koei and Microsoft.NINJA GAIDEN timeline featuring games where Ryu Hayabusa appears or is mentionedYAIBA: NINJA GAIDEN Z (Dark Horse Comic)（Assumption, several years prior to YAIBA）\n↓\nNinja Ryukenden GB Shadow\n↓1 year\nNINJA GAIDEN\n↓6 months\nNINJA GAIDEN Dragon Sword\n↓5 months\nThe Vampire War\n↓shortly after\nNINJA GAIDEN 2\n↓several months\nSHIN SANGOKU MUSOU MULTI RAID （Assumption）\n↓\nSHIN SANGOKU MUSOU VS （Assumption）\n↓\nMUSOU OROCHI 2\n↓shortly after\nNINJA GAIDEN 3\n↓shortly after\nYAIBA: NINJA GAIDEN Z\n↓\nNINJA GAIDEN X\n↓shortly after\nNinja Ryukenden\n↓6 months\nNinja Ryukenden III The Ancient Ship of Doom\n↓6 months\nNinja Ryukenden II The Dark Sword of Chaos\n↓shortly after\nNinja Ryukenden OVA\n↓\nDEAD OR ALIVE Dimensions\n↓shortly after\nDEAD OR ALIVE\n↓shortly after\nDEAD OR ALIVE 2\n↓shortly after\nDEAD OR ALIVE 3\n↓shortly after\nDEAD OR ALIVE 4\n↓\nDEAD OR ALIVE XTREME 2\n↓\nDEAD OR ALIVE Paradise\n↓2 years\nDEAD OR ALIVE 5\n\n\nEither unrelated to the timeline or not enough information to place:\nNinja Ryukenden(AC) Set in 1999\nNinja Gaiden(GG)\nNinja Gaiden(MS)\n","title":"","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/71/Ninja_Gaiden_logo.png/250px-Ninja_Gaiden_logo.png","developer":"","genre":""},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninja_Warriors","description":"The Ninja Warriors (ニンジャウォーリアーズ?) is a side-scrolling beat'em up video game developed and released by Taito in 1987. The original arcade game version used an unusual screen setup that situated one display in between projected images of two other displays, creating the appearance of a triple-wide screen. Versions of the game were subsequently released for a variety of home platforms, including various personal computers, and were mostly well received. A remake known as The Ninja Warriors Again was developed by Natsume and released for the SNES in 1994.The Ninja Warriors presents side-scrolling hand-to-hand combat. Players take control of Kunoichi (player 1) or Ninja (player 2) and fight wave after wave of Banglar forces across five levels. Button 1 attacks with a short-range kunai slash, while button 2 fires long-range shurikens that are limited in supply.The Ninja Warriors received mostly positive reviews, especially its 16-bit versions such as the one for the Amiga. In 2010, CraveOnline featured it on the list of top ten ninja games of all time.[18] In 2008, GamesRadar featured Kunoichi as the best assassin in the video game history, stating: \"She cut a memorable figure, rocking the huge blonde ponytail and bright-red shozoku. On top of that, she wasn't just a ninja - she was a ninja Terminator. It's hard to imagine a better assassin than that.\"[19] In 2006, Akiman drew her as his girl of the month for the Japanese magazine GAMAGA.[20] Robert Workman of GameZone included Ninja and Kunoichi on his 2011 list of \"best video game ninjas\" and stated: \"These guys are due for a return – and hopefully a better hyped one than Kage got a few years ago on DS?\"[21]Natsume developed a 1994 SNES-exclusive remake also known as The Ninja Warriors for a number of its releases, normally known as The Ninja Warriors Again. It shares the original arcade game but the gameplay has been heavily modified.","title":"The Ninja Warriors","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4f/The_Ninja_Warriors_arcade_flyer.jpg/220px-The_Ninja_Warriors_arcade_flyer.jpg","developer":"Taito Corporation","genre":"Beat 'em up"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Escape_(1994_film)#Video_game","description":"No Escape, released in some countries as Escape from Absolom, is a 1994 American action/science fiction film directed by Martin Campbell and starring Ray Liotta, Lance Henriksen, Stuart Wilson, Kevin Dillon and Ernie Hudson. It was based on the 1987 novel The Penal Colony, by Richard Herley.The story, set in a dystopian future, concerns a former Marine who is serving life imprisonment on an island inhabited by savage and cannibalistic prisoners. It was shot in Queensland, Australia.In the year 2022, the penal system is run entirely by corporations, with prisoners seen as assets. Highly-trained ex-marine John Robbins is imprisoned for life for murdering his commanding officer, who in 2011 ordered him to kill scores of innocent men, women and children in Benghazi (Libya). The event haunts Robbins over a decade later.Robbins had escaped from two Level 5 maximum security prisons and is now incarcerated in a Level 6 facility. A fellow prisoner tells him about \"Absolom\" [sic], an island where they send the worst prisoners—a place feared more than the prison. The warden, after he is held at gunpoint by Robbins, is convinced that Robbins is a threat and exiles him to the island.Once on the island, Robbins is captured by a numerous group of prisoners known as the 'Outsiders', whose only order is The Law of the Jungle and are led by a sociopath named Marek. The island —previously a private retreat with dilapidated houses and a swimming pool— is where the Outsiders have established a base. Marek insists that Robbins fight one of his men for his amusement. Marek is impressed when Robbins kills his opponent in seconds, and offers him a position in his gang. Robbins instead knocks Marek into a pool, steals his rocket launcher, and flees from the Outsider's camp. Pursued through the jungle, he ends up trapped at the edge of a high cliff where he is shot in the neck by blowgun darts. He falls into the river below, where he washes up on some rocks and is retrieved by another group, called the 'Insiders'.Robbins awakens inside the Insiders' camp, which is led by a terminally-ill doctor called 'The Father', who put together a cooperative autonomous community with laws opposed to the tyranny of the Outsiders. He also meets King, the new-arrival helper, and Casey, a young man given a life sentence for taking part in a high-profile kidnapping. The Insiders number exactly 98, while the Outsiders total over 600. Robbins learns that he is the only person to have ever challenged and escaped from Marek's camp and that the weapon he stole had been appropriated for the good of the community.After an attack by the Outsiders, The Father notes Robbins's resourcefulness and combat acumen and asks Robbins to join them. He refuses and says he wants to leave Absolom. Robbins is taken to the shore, where he learns that they are 200 miles from the mainland, and that there are gunships 50 miles off the coast. The prisoners are also being tracked by infrared satellite technology, mainly there to detect significant thermal activity such as large fires or explosions that could tip off other agencies. Other than that, the Warden lets the prisoners do what they want, including killing each other off.Marek, back at the Outsider's camp, disposes of all the leaders of the various gangs that compose the Outsiders, giving himself a solidified force. He then starts controlling rations to keep the troops in line.The Insiders have secretly built a scan-proof boat and launch it, manned by secret volunteers to escape the island and tell the outside world about Absolom. However, somehow the boat is detected by the attack helicopters and is destroyed.Robbins learns of the Insiders' plan to escape using another motorboat, and he demands a seat, determined to escape so he can tell the authorities the truth behind the civilian deaths in Libya and of Absolom. He learns that the Insiders' boat engine needs a distributor, a part which Robbins saw while in Marek's camp. Robbins offers to get the part in exchange for a seat on the boat, and the Insiders agree. Robbins infiltrates the Outsiders' camp and gets the engine part, but he is captured by the Outsiders. He is then forced to fight Casey, who secretly tailed Robbins to the camp but was caught in a booby trap. Casey impales and kills himself on Robbin's weapon, and Robbins is taken to be executed. With the help of an Insider spy, Robbins escapes from the camp again, which infuriates Marek, who announces an all-out war with the Insiders.Over stern objection, Robbins convinces the Insiders to abandon their camp. However, he stays behind to fire a rocket launcher, which ignites an incendiary bomb that kills most of the Outsiders. It also triggers the satellite infrared sensors, causing the Warden to send troops to the island. Marek survives and attacks Robbins, but the Father defends him before he can deliver the final blow. Marek kills The Father and Robbins kills Marek just as the Insiders get the boat engine working. The boat is suddenly blown up and the boat builder is stabbed by the informer. Robbins learns that King is the informer in the Insiders' camp who has been contacting the Warden by radio, informing him of each escape attempt made. Robbins forces King to give false information to the Warden, so that he lands his helicopter on the island and looks for the informant. Robbins hijacks the helicopter, throwing the Warden off the ship, and escapes from Absolom, vowing to spread the truth about the island. King and the Warden are left behind, looking anxiously to the trees as the unseen Outsiders close in on them.In 1994, Marvel Comics published a three-issue comic book limited series adaptation of the original novel and movie screenplay. The series was written by Roger Salick, penciled by Mike Harris, and inked by Chris Ivy.A video game based on the film was released in 1994 for Sega Genesis, Super Nintendo Entertainment System, and PC.[1]Parts of the Warden's speeches at the start of the film have been re-edited and used on the track \"Immune\" from the eponymous first album of the band Godsmack.

It was also ported for the SNES, by Bullet-Proof Software.King Cullen passed control of the peaceful land Obitus to his four sons, warning them to stand united or the land would fall into evil hands. To symbolise the unity, the king gave each of his sons a Gem of Tranquility, which when joined conjured a mystical force to protect the land.Some time after the transfer of power took place, an enchantress named Salome sought to take advantage of the princes' fraternal pact. She told them each in confidence that they must break from the others in order to obtain personal wealth and power. The princes took these words to heart and fought for control of the kingdom. When the battle was over, each prince had one of the gems and one quarter of the land. The power of the gems had been broken. Only by reuniting them in the Tower Obitus can the kingdom be saved.Obitus is essentially an adventure video game, but with some arcade-style action as well. It combines several graphics styles and perspectives. It is a labyrinth game. Though nearly every piece of a forest or catacomb looks indistinguishable from the next screen, this can be dealt with by the player making physical maps, using the compass. The game is heavily focused on the need to make maps. Without them, the player will die long before making it to the end. There is very little food and time cannot be wasted walking around trying to find a way forward.Computer Gaming World liked the no-typing interface, graphics, and sound, but stated that the documentation was so poor that players would be better off not reading it.

The game is arguably a very loose adaptation of the raid at Entebbe: The \"North African province Kalubya\" in the game is in a location in Africa that corresponds to the location of Libya in real life; the name of the province is an obvious corruption of Libya (possibly a portmanteau with Kaboom or Kablooey), and both involved hijacked airliners, hostages and a commando raid (the hijackers landed the plane in Libya to refuel before proceeding to Uganda; the game unifies the two locations).","title":"Operation Thunderbolt","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4c/Operation_Thunderbolt_%28video_game%29_titlescreen.jpg/220px-Operation_Thunderbolt_%28video_game%29_titlescreen.jpg","developer":"Taito","genre":"Shooting gallery"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_(video_game)","description":"Oscar is a platform game that was released on Amiga 500, Amiga 1200, Amiga CD32, MS-DOS and SNES in 1993, and was developed and published by Flair Software.

The game tells a story of Lester, a young scientist who, as a result of an experiment gone wrong, finds himself in a dangerous alien world where he is forced to fight for his survival.Another World was highly innovative in its use of cinematic effects in both real-time and cutscenes, which earned the game praise amongst critics and commercial success. It also influenced a number of other video games and designers.Another World is a platform game, featuring a control scheme wherin the player uses either the keyboard, joystick or gamepad to make the protagonist run, jump, attack and perform other, situation specific actions such as rocking a cage back and forth. In the initial part of the game, Lester is unarmed. He is able to kick at small creatures but is otherwise defenseless.The game's French designer Eric Chahi had previously worked as a game programmer and then as a graphic designer for video games since 1983. It was the success of his earlier work with Paul Cuisset as a graphic designer for the adventure game Future Wars for Delphine Software and its royalties that gave him the chance to develop Another World \"without any constraint of any sort or any editorial pressure.\" After Future Wars was released in 1989, Chahi had the choice to either work on Cuisset's next game, Operation Stealth, or create his own game. As \"there had been many books and tools released to develop easily on the Amiga at that time,\" Chahi felt confident that he could go back to programming.[9]Another World was influenced by everything I liked at that time of my life - mainly by pictorial art, movies and science fiction books, like Dune or Hyperion. Comics and fantasy art also inspired me; artists like Michael Whelan, Richard Corben, Frank Miller and Frank Frazetta.After 17 months of development, Chahi was only about one-third completed with the game, and realized that this rate would have been impractical. He began to take steps to simplify the development, including reusing background graphics and creating building blocks that allowed him to focus more on the game's puzzles. At the same time, he began to seek a publisher for the game. He first spoke to his former employer, Delphine Software, but also sought other distributors. One, Virgin Interactive, were favorable to Chahi's game but had suggested that he change it to a point-and-click style adventure game. Chahi had considered changing the game by this request but realized \"the effort to do this would have been too huge, and some friends who played the game loved it.\"[13] Ultimately, he accepted Delphine's offer in June 1991, and set a tentative release date in November. To meet this deadline, Chahi used storyboards to sketch out the rest of the game's plot, balancing the overall pacing of the game. One ending captured on these storyboards but abandoned was Lester becoming the leader of the alien world. The game was finished in 1991, which inspired the game's tagline: \"It took six days to create the Earth. Another World took two years\"; Chahi noted his own exhaustion at completing this project mirrors in the near-death of Lester at the end of the game.[10]The game was released in North America under the title Out of This World in order to avoid confusion with the popular but unrelated soap opera television series Another World. Coincidentally, the science fiction sitcom Out of This World aired at the same time of the game's USA-Canada release.Through Interplay Entertainment, the game was ported to the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES), the Sega Genesis (Mega Drive), and the Apple IIGS in 1992. The SNES, Sega Mega-CD (Sega CD), 3DO and Apple IIGS ports each contain a prologue before the introduction begins, which consists of an entry that comes from Lester's diary. The Mega Drive port's prologue is different from that of the SNES and 3DO ports. The Mega-CD version of Another World combines the original game (with CD quality new music by Freitas) with the sequel, Heart of the Alien,[14] and was released in North America as Heart of the Alien: Out of This World Parts I and II.All of the console versions include some form of dynamic musical score during gameplay, and in the case of the Sega Mega Drive and Genesis conversions, use arrangements of the music originating in the SNES and Apple IIGS versions. This differs from other versions which only have music for the opening and ending segments. Interplay wanted to add additional tunes by Charles Deenen. They also wanted to exchange Jean-François Freitas's music for a different soundtrack, but Chahi did not agree to the change and Delphine's lawyer helped to keep the original intro music.[14] The Apple IIGS and Super NES versions were programmed by Rebecca Heineman, who said: \"Since Interplay wouldn't pay for a Super FX chip, I found a way to do it with static RAM on the cart and DMA which got me a great frame rate. Interplay wouldn't pay for the static RAM either, so I ended up using Fast ROM instruction. Interplay wouldn't pay for a 3.6 Mhz ROM either. So, frustrated, I shoved my block move code into the DMA registers and use it as RAM running at 3.6 Mhz. It worked. I got fast block moves on slow cartridges and made a game using polygons working on a 65816 with pure software rendering.\"[15] Another World is the only game directly ported from the Super NES to the Apple IIGS, which has the same 65C816 microprocessor.Chahi acquired the rights to Another World '​s intellectual property from Delphine Software International after they closed down in July 2004. Magic Productions then offered to port the game to mobile phones, and it was ported with help from Cyril Cogordan. Chahi saw that the game's playability could be improved, so he used his old Amiga for reprogramming certain parts of the script and made the graphics' shading clearer in order to counter mobile phones' low resolutions.[14] In July 2005, almost a decade and a half after it was first released on the Amiga, the game was released for mobile phone handsets using the Symbian operating system, thanks to Telcogames and developer Magic Productions.[18] In 2006, Magic Productions also released a remastered Pocket PC version for Windows Mobile 5 OS or higher in QVGA (320×240 resolution).[18] Telcogames entered administration in 2008, closing the Magic Productions studio. The administrator's letter to stakeholders mentions that its assets will be sold, but does not indicate to whom or mention Another World assets by name.[19]In 2012 an Atari Jaguar port of Another World was confirmed and approved by Chahi. It was released as a limited collector's item in cartridge form complete with a box and manual published by the association Retro-gaming Connexion (RGC) in 2013. The game engine was rewritten especially for the Atari Jaguar to make use of the several of the console's processors: render polygons using the GPU and blitter; decompress data on-the-fly using the GPU; play stereo music and sound effects using the DSP; and JIT-compile and execute the scripts of the game using the 68k CPU. The Jaguar version is playable in the original graphics 16-color mode and Deluxe 15th Anniversary graphics 256-color mode. It can be played in normal and speed-run modes; it also supports five languages: English, German, French, Italian and Spanish.[20][21]The game does not include Interplay's extra music, but it includes the extra level, as well as the added enemies and hazards from the console versions. This version is part of the Another World 15th Anniversary Edition CD-ROM released in 2007, which also includes a development diary, an exclusive postcard autographed by Chahi and a separate soundtrack CD.[23] The CD-ROM version of 15th Anniversary Edition contains strict digital rights management technology – upon installation, the game verifies the user's serial number through the Internet, allowing only for five installations of the game using any given serial number. Uninstallation does not reset the count, so after five installations, the player must purchase a new copy. This problem does not exist on the digital copy sold by GOG.com.[7]The console versions of the 20th Anniversary port were released by Digital Lounge for Xbox One, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita, Wii U, and Nintendo 3DS in June 2014.[28][29] The three PlayStation versions allow cross-platform functionality. According to Digital Lounge, the goal was to \"simply to deliver the original experience of Another World faithfully, with the benefits of today’s hardware and a high level of polish. Chahi said the animations were \"refined to remove the rough edges revealed by such a high resolution rendering\" of up to 2560×1600 pixels.[27]In 2011, Fabien Sanglard analysed Another World by reverse engineering and reconstructed a complete C++ source code variant of the internal virtual machine.[32][33]Another World was met with widespread critical acclaim. American magazine Computer Gaming World praised the game's graphics and Amiga sound but criticized the brief documentation and short length of gameplay, and called it \"one of Europe's most playable and enjoyable arcade efforts.\"[50] The Lessers of Dragon gave the game 5 out of 5 stars and called it \"an adventure that will keep [the player] on the edge of [one's] seat for some time to come.\"[51] Among many other accolades, it was named as number one top new Amiga game of 1992 by Amiga World[52] and received the award for the Most Innovative New Game of the year from Electronic Gaming Monthly.[53] The game was commercially successful too, selling around 1 million copies during the 1990s.[54] In 2012, Another World became one of the first 14 titles added to the video game art exposition at the Museum of Modern Art.[55][56]Retrospectively, Kristan Reed of Eurogamer called Another World \"one of the most visionary and memorable games of its time.\"[9] Reviewing the 15th Anniversary Edition in 2010, Eurogamer's John Walker called it \"still utterly beautiful\", adding that the game's art style is \"just fantastic. Chahi's design is exquisitely simple and enormously evocative. Built from spare polygons, its paper-craft-like animation conjures the world, the creatures and the threat wonderfully.\"[7] In a 2014 review of the 3DS version, Bob Mackey of USGamer opined \"Another World is definitely an experience every gamer should have—and not just for the sake of checking out a historical curiosity. Another World still feels incredibly forward-thinking, almost as if Chahi had developed a game for this decade's indie scene without even realizing it.\"[58]In 2011, Wirtualna Polska ranked the \"visionary\" Another World as the 15th best game for the Amiga, remembering it for a cinematic feel and \"uncommonly\" high difficulty (for a first-time player) and calling it \"one of the most important titles in the history of electronic entertainment.\"[59] In 2012, 1UP.com ranked this \"short-but-sweet cinematic action game\" as the 99th most essential video game of all time, commenting: \"Especially in an age of entertainment where fans cry out for pages upon pages lore and glossaries for the tiniest minutiae of their fiction, Out of this World '​s dimension contains a sense of mystery that makes it all the more lonely, and often, quietly beautiful. The game can be brutal and heartbreaking, but Chahi's amazing vision makes [it] a thoroughly gripping experience.\"[6] That same year, Lucas Sullivan of GamesRadar named it as number one top \"cult-classic franchise\" that should be rebooted in a way Prince of Persia was, commenting that \"despite a small cast of characters, minimalist gameplay, and some truly grueling difficulty, Another World... resonated with gamers in ways they weren't expecting. The game's vivid vector graphics were utterly stunning at the time, and the pacing of the heavy, nicely animated platforming naturally melded with taking in the sights of the sublime alien landscape,\" and adding that \"slowly adapting to the hostile surroundings offered a hard-earned satisfaction and a surprisingly moving story.\"[5]In addition, the beast creature from the first level was ranked sixth on the GameSpot's 1999 list of the best monsters in gaming,[60] while the alien \"Buddy\" was ranked third on the list of the ten best sidekicks in 2000, along with a comment that the \"groundbreaking\" Another World \"is one of those rare games that everybody seemed to love.\"[61] In 2012, IGN ranked the game's laser gun as the 86th best weapon in gaming history.[4] Discussing \"Buddy\" in 2013, Rock, Paper, Shotgun's Adam Smith called him still \"one of gaming’s greatest companions\".[62]A sequel titled Heart of the Alien was developed by Interplay and released exclusively for the Sega Mega-CD in 1994. The game is similar in graphics and gameplay, as the player plays as Lester's alien friend Mycaruba. Chahi had nothing to do with the development of the sequel, beyond suggesting \"redesigning the game from the alien point of view,\" by which he meant making an alternative version of the original game but was misunderstood.[14] In 2014, Polish filmmaker Bartek Hławka created a live-action fan film titled Another World: The Movie.[63]The French company which produced Another World, Delphine Software, has since gone into administrative receivership and Another World remains their most recognized game. Paul Cuisset's 1992 game Flashback, also released by Delphine but created without any involvement from Chahi, features similar gameplay and graphics and makes a few nods to Another World, including the use of personal force fields in combat, a nearly identical end text in the ending cutscene, and an almost exact motion recreation of the gun pickup cutscene. A very similar plot premise was used in 1999's Outcast by Infogrames.[7] The game had also a big influence on several game other designers. Fumito Ueda cited it as an inspiration for his creation of Ico.[67] Hideo Kojima, creator of the Metal Gear Solid series, said that it was one of the five games that influenced him the most.[68] Video game designer Goichi Suda called it his favourite game.[69]Chahi returned to the concept of cinematic platform games after leaving Delphine. In 1998, he and his company Amazing Studio made Heart of Darkness, which is in many ways a spiritual successor to Another World. After that, Chahi disappeared from the game industry for several years, but in 2005 he regained interest in making video games.[70] In 2011, Ubisoft released his next game, From Dust.","title":"Another World","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b9/Another_World_Coverart.png/250px-Another_World_Coverart.png","developer":"Delphine Software","genre":"Cinematic platformer"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_to_Lunch_(video_game)","description":"Pierre le Chef is...

Game Gear and Game Boy versions followed in 1994. The Game Boy and Game Boy Color releases also feature a Super Game Boy enhanced color palette. Although Cosmo Gang the Puzzle was released to the arcades, there was never an arcade version of Pac-Attack. The game was also known as 'Pac-Man: Pac-Attack' and 'Pac-Panic'.[1]Pac-Attack can also be played in 2-player mode. Player 1 must eat Blinky, while Player 2 must eat Sue, the purple ghost from Pac-Mania. As players eat ghosts and complete lines, they will drop ghosts on their opponent's board, messing up their board and bringing them closer to the top. This game can even be played in puzzle mode. The object of this mode is to smash all 100 stages by getting rid all of the ghosts on the board with the limited number of Pac-Man's for each stage. In the event of a Game Over, all the regular blocks appear with red crosses on them. Players can then retry the level.This version of Pac-Attack includes new graphics, music, and modes, as well as some improvements over the 1993 version, such as a bar indicating when Pac-Man or the Fairy is coming and which Ghosts can and cannot be eaten. It also has a \"Godhand\" mode, where the player attempts to reach level 999 while all the blocks came down at intense speeds. Also, Pac-Man and the Fairy take longer to appear. The music was composed by Takaki Horigome, a musician from the Japanese band Kirinji. This version of Pac-Attack was released as an unlockable game in Pac-Man World 2 but with the puzzle mode omitted from the Namco Anthology 2 version removed.Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the Game Gear version a 6.6 out of 10, commenting, \"Not relying on fancy graphic effects, Pac-Attack is the type of puzzle game designed for Game Gear. ... play this game a few times and you'll definitely get hooked on this smaller version.\"[3] GamePro gave the Genesis version a mildly positive review, saying that the game's multiple play modes, while derivative, are enjoyable and challenging.[4]","title":"Pac-Attack","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/27/Pac-Attack_Coverart.png/250px-Pac-Attack_Coverart.png","developer":"Namco","genre":"Puzzle"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-In-Time","description":"Pac-In-Time (パックインタイム?) is a video game developed by Kalisto and published by Namco, featuring the popular arcade character Pac-Man.

The game is directly based upon the animated television series Phantom 2040 but follows a plotline not strictly taken by the show.[2]The game follows primarily side-scrolling action elements not unlike those of the SNES game Super Metroid, but other aspects of gameplay are considerably different. While Super Metroid has the player focus on collecting necessary weapons and upgrades in a set order, Phantom 2040 instead makes upgrades optional and has the player focus on following the story of the 24th Phantom, who the player controls. However, this style of game progression draws the game back to Super Metroid's style, due to the way further locations are unlocked as the game goes on without previous locations becoming unavailable. At several points in the storyline, players can make a direct choice about which path they take.Also like Super Metroid, Phantom 2040 has a heavy emphasis on exploration. Each area is colourful, distinct and vast, and it is up to the player to locate the area's objective or exit. Some areas are larger and more expansive than others, and every area offers large amounts of optional exploration to recover helpful restoration kits or powerful weapon upgrades. Some areas are locked by numbered gates that must be opened by destroying the remote lock of the same number, located elsewhere in that area (additionally, some locks can only be accessed if the area is reached by a secret underground network of sewer systems which connect every area). Most exploration is completely optional, and players can go directly to complete the area's objective, which may include locating a keycard, dealing with a boss or simply finding access to the next area. The majority of areas can all be revisited at the player's leisure anytime after they are unlocked.The story line in Phantom 2040 is presented differently in the NTSC and PAL versions of the game. In the NTSC version of Phantom 2040 in the options menu the player has the choice of having the games story presented to them in full or in summary. The full version provides cinematics between levels and dialog between characters. The summarized version gives a short point-list of what happens in those cinematics.While the backstory Phantom 2040 is exactly the same as the backstory of the television series, the video game doesn't specifically enact any of the series' episodes but instead borrows elements from various episodes and sets out a start-to-finish, almost movie-like story of the Phantom's mission to stop Maximum, Inc. from dominating Metropia.","title":"Phantom 2040","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Phantom_2040_game_cover.jpg/250px-Phantom_2040_game_cover.jpg","developer":"Sunsoft","genre":"Adventure"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pieces_(game)","description":"Pieces (known in Japan as Jigsaw Party (ジグソーパ〜ティ〜?)) is a 1994 puzzle game for the SNES published by Atlus.

It was developed by Nintendo's Entertainment Analysis and Development (EAD) division, led by producer Shigeru Miyamoto. The game was originally released in Japan on December 21, 1990, shortly after the launch of the SNES. It was released as a launch title for the console on August 23, 1991 in North America, with a European release following in 1992.Pilotwings is an amateur flight simulator game in which the player attempts to earn pilot licenses through lessons in light plane flight, hang gliding, skydiving, and the use of a rocket belt. Bonus stages and levels involving an attack helicopter are also available. Each event offers unique controls and gameplay mechanics. To increase the realism of the game's flight simulation, the developers extensively utilized the SNES's Mode 7 capability, which mimics 3D graphics by rotating and scaling flat objects.The game was well received upon its release, largely thanks to its graphical presentation. The game has since been re-released on the Virtual Console service for both the Wii and the Wii U consoles in PAL regions, North America, and Japan. A sequel, Pilotwings 64, was released for the Nintendo 64 in 1996. After many years of announcements and cancellations, Nintendo unveiled a second sequel, Pilotwings Resort, for the Nintendo 3DS handheld at the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) 2010 which released in 2011.Pilotwings takes place in a series of training areas called the \"Flight Club\". The player's objective is to pass each training area and earn licenses based on the difficulty of the courses.[7] Each area features events, which may be played in any order. In these events, the player controls one of four aerial vehicles and must complete a task (usually flying through floating markers) within a time limit. Upon completing or failing an objective, the player earns points and receives comments from the instructors.[8] Points are awarded based on criteria such as the time taken to complete the event, the accuracy of the landing, and the completion of certain tasks, such as flying through colored rings or orbs. To pass a training area, the combined scores from each event must exceed a certain threshold.[7] Each training area can be replayed if necessary, and passwords allow players to save their progress.[8]Pilotwings was developed by Nintendo Entertainment Analysis and Development (EAD), a team consisting of members of the company's Research & Development divisions, under the leadership of producer Shigeru Miyamoto.[15] Nintendo EAD completed Pilotwings and two other games (Super Mario World and F-Zero) within 15 months of the debut of the Super Nintendo Entertainment System.[15] Pilotwings was released in Japan on December 21, 1990, one month after the system's launch, and was later released in North America on August 23, 1991 as a launch title.[1][2][16] The game's musical score was composed by Japanese-born musician Soyo Oka, while her superior Koji Kondo was responsible for the sound programming.[17] Six tracks from the game, including a rearranged version of the skydiving theme, appeared on the Nintendo Super Famicom Game Music album, released in Japan on March 4, 1992.[18] Six piano-arranged versions of songs from the game were included on the Nintendo Super Famicom Game Music: Fun Together with Beyer CD, which was released in Japan on November 30, 1993.[19]A flight simulator game resembling Pilotwings called Dragonfly was shown during the official unveiling of the SNES to the Japanese press on November 21, 1988.[20][21] The game was used to demonstrate the system's Mode 7 graphics system, which allows rotation, scaling, and other effects to be used on flat images to create a 3D effect.[22] Because the game does not use the coprocessor chip Super FX, the true SNES 3D technology, the buildings, runway, trees, and so on are all \"painted\" flat on the ground plane, and they appear to stick out of the ground when the player's viewpoint is far above.[23][24]Pilotwings was positively received during both its initial release and in retrospective reviews. The game drew praise for its presentation, with publications describing the game's use of Mode 7 graphics as \"stunning\" and \"jaw-dropping\".[29][31] Its level of challenge was also positively noted; Mean Machines found that practicing the flight tests and reaching the end of the game was very rewarding.[31] Official Nintendo Magazine remarked, \"This early SNES title is still enjoyable enough to be considered a true classic.\"[22]In February 2006, Pilotwings was listed as the 153rd best game on a Nintendo console by Nintendo Power.[33] They also listed it as the 20th best game on the SNES.[34] IGN listed it in their \"Top 100 Games of All Time\" at number 74 in 2003, and at number 91 in 2007.[35][36] They later placed it as the 80th best SNES game.[37] It was named the 16th best game on the SNES by GameDaily in 2008,[38] while Game Informer listed it at number 131 in its \"Top 200 Games of All Time\" in 2009.[39] Official Nintendo Magazine ranked the game number 61 on its February 2009 \"100 Best Nintendo Games\" list.[40] In April 1996, Super Play listed it as the tenth greatest game for the SNES.[41]Computer and Video Games stated that Pilotwings sold over two million copies worldwide by August 1996.[42] A sequel, Pilotwings 64, was released for the Nintendo 64 in 1996 as a launch title for its respective system.[43] A second sequel for the Nintendo 64, which showed off the console's capabilities, was cancelled.[44] In 2003, it was announced that Factor 5 was working on a GameCube incarnation of the Pilotwings series.[45] Development was moved to Nintendo's Wii console shortly thereafter. However, an anonymous blogger claimed in late 2009 that Factor 5 had indeed finished working on it, but that Nintendo was not confident in publishing it.[46] Nintendo finally announced a new title in the series, the Nintendo 3DS title Pilotwings Resort, at E3 2010.[47] The new title was released as a launch title for the 3DS in North America on March 27, 2011.[48]The game has been featured in the Game On historical exhibition organized by the Barbican Centre, including a display at the Science Museum in London in 2007.[49] Nintendo re-released Pilotwings on the Wii Virtual Console service in PAL regions and North America in 2009 and in Japan in 2010,[4][5][6] and then on the Wii U Virtual Console in 2013.A stage based on Pilotwings will make an appearance in Super Smash Bros. for Wii U. The stage combines elements from the original SNES game and Pilotwings Resort.","title":"Pilotwings","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/2b/Pilotwings_Box.jpg/250px-Pilotwings_Box.jpg","developer":"Nintendo EAD","genre":"Amateur flight simulation"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinball_Dreams","description":"Pinball Dreams is a pinball simulation video game developed by Digital Illusions CE and originally released for the Amiga in 1992.

A further sequel was released in 1995 called Pinball Illusions.Like Pinball Dreams, Pinball Fantasies contains four themed tables with various difficulty levels.There are several programming glitches in conversions of Pinball Fantasies that do not occur in the original Amiga version. Some of these are more serious than others. None of the tables are unaffected, since one specific glitch affects three tables and the remaining one (Billion Dollar) is afflicted with a separate error.The most major error in Pinball Fantasies is the way Hold Bonus is treated. Most simulations such as Slam Tilt hold only the unmultiplied bonus to the next ball; Pinball Fantasies holds the full bonus awarded to the player. This has various effects on each table, depending on its features, but is generally most effective on Stones 'N Bones.Both Pinball Dreams and Pinball Fantasies are considered cult games in the pinball simulation world.[by whom?] Pinball Fantasies was more technically advanced than its predecessor, offering many new features that the original didn't. For example, each of the pinball tables was now three screens high instead of two, all tables except Stones 'N Bones supported three flippers, and the in-game animations (though sparse) were more advanced.Neither set of tables supported true multiball play, but Nightmare (Pinball Dreams) and Stones 'N Bones (Pinball Fantasies) offered fake multiball. While Nightmare's Jackpot was lit, two locks would hold a ball which increased the Jackpot multiplier, the lock would be temporarily inaccessible, and meanwhile another ball was provided to launch. Multi Demons is an extension of this idea, simply with a time limit added.On any table, while the table is scrolling up and down, any of the following are confirmed cheats on some versions of Pinball Fantasies. A preliminary code - cheats may have to be typed first on some versions, and others have no cheats at all.","title":"Pinball Fantasies","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/6c/Pinball_Fantasies.jpg/250px-Pinball_Fantasies.jpg","developer":"Digital Illusions CE","genre":"Pinball"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pink_Goes_to_Hollywood&action=edit&redlink=1","description":"Other reasons this message may be displayed:\n","title":"","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b4/Wiktionary-logo-en.png/28px-Wiktionary-logo-en.png","developer":"","genre":""},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pirates_of_Dark_Water#Other_media","description":"The Pirates of Dark Water is a fantasy animated series produced by Hanna-Barbera and Created by David Kirschner in 1991.[1]The alien world of Mer is being devoured by an evil substance known as Dark Water. Only Ren, a young prince, can stop it by finding the lost Thirteen Treasures of Rule. His loyal crew of misfits that help in his journey are an ecomancer (Tula), a monkey-bird (Niddler), and a treasure-hungry pirate (Ioz). The evil pirate lord, Bloth, will stop at nothing to get the treasures for himself and provides many obstacles for Ren and his crew.The show first premiered on Fox Kids in early 1991 as a five-part mini-series titled Dark Water. Following a number of animation tweaks and other changes by Hanna-Barbera, those episodes were rebroadcast later in 1991 as the first five episodes of the regular series. Most notably, the original mini-series featured the voice of Roddy McDowall as Niddler, whereas in the revised version, the character was voiced by Frank Welker. The first season aired on ABC, while the second season aired in first-run syndication as part of The Funtastic World of Hanna-Barbera.The series was never completed, ending abruptly after 21 episodes with only eight of the thirteen treasures collected.Mer is a world very different from Earth, with a variety of its own creatures with varying degrees of intelligence, such as the monkey-bird and the leviathan. The world has twenty seas, and most of the crew's stops are made at islands. Parts of Mer are continually in flux, like a river of spiked rocks that rises out of the ocean in the first episode and appears to defy physics (none of the characters are bewildered by the spectacle aside from its danger), but whether this is the Dark Water's doing or just the nature of the geologically hyperactive planet is unknown.Octopon was once the greatest city on Mer, referred to as \"the jewel in the crown of Mer\" by Ioz in episode 14, though it lies in ruin until Ren collects the first seven Treasures. It is then partially restored. Octopon seems to have been centuries ahead of the current technological state of Mer, although it is probable that civilization is continually in decline due to the Dark Water oozing from the planet's core.Ren discovers that he is the son of a (now deceased) king Primus. He escapes Bloth with a new friend Niddler and they travel to a ship port. There they befriend a pirate Ioz and a runaway girl Tula.After rescuing Teron from the Maelstrom Ren and the crew stopped to gather supplies but are interrupted by Bloth and his men. During the pursuit the wind up in Andorus where it is revealed that Tula is an ecomancer and they find the place in ruins. Teron and Tula try to use their powers to restore the island but something evil is around and guarding one of the treasures.While running from Bloth the crew rescues an old woman named Cray who knew Ren's Father Primus and is an alchemist. She saves them but offers anything for a sample of Dark Water to use in a potion of hers but Ren refuses. She then uses one of her potions on Tula to force Ren to do her bidding and uses the dark water in a potion to make herself young again in an attempt to reclaim her youth.Ren sees a vision of his father telling him if he rings \"the bell of the first sound\" that all the dark water will be gone forever but when he rings the bell he finds out that it was all a trick by an imprisoned servant of the Darkdweller. Ren swears to reimprison the monster he freed by accident.The crew finds another treasure but it is guarded by a creature that can only be defeated by feeding it a loac flower(the best cure on Mer for most illnesses). Ren sets off into the swamp guided by creature with a mysterious past given to them by a shady Bio-transmuter.Niddler is supposed to be a king to a tribe of non-flying monkey birds. What he doesn't know, however is that he is also the only hope of defeating a giant dangerous creature, which he can't do...The crew encounter a wizard who \"collects\" ships by shrinking them. While trying to save Ioz they are shrunk as well and left stuck in a glass bottle.Ren saves a baby leviathan and a bond is born. However, both leviathan, Ren and Ioz are taken captives by Bloth.While once again running from Bloth the crew is forced to leave the Wraith but Tula falls victim to the dark water in the process. Ren is shaken and they are captured by Bloth but a slight glimmer of hope comes when it seems that Tula may still be alive. Ren them escapes and takes the treasures and enters the realm of the Darkdweller to search for his lost friend.The Wraith is damaged during yet another escape from Bloth and the only nearby port is Octopon but it's in ruins and overrun by the servants of the Darkdweller.Blinded by greed Ioz tries to steal a treasure from a seemingly deserted ship. Unfortunately, it appears that the ship is full of ghosts, who want to make Ioz one of them.While washed ashore Ren and Niddler encounter \"the dagron master\". He offers to help them to find one of the treasures, but in the middle of journey Ren finds he has been tricked and is turned into one of the reptiles.Two strange creatures in control of a moving island interrupt Bloth just as he is about to capture Ren. They then blackmail Ren and Bloth chaining the two together and making them play their deadly game while competing with their best warriors while betting on the contest.When Ren and his crew are taking a break back in Octopon the Queen of the monkey birds shows up asking Niddler for help. She says that there is a plague on Pandawa and that Niddler needs to protect the egg of the future queen. Ren and Nibler fly ahead but there may be more to this plague than a simple disease.The crew is forced to go to port to buy supplies after Konk destroys what they had gathered. There Ren bumps into Solia, Ioz's sister, who is a pickpocket with an eye to go hunt a treasure located on the most dangerous island in Mer. When Ren and Ioz refuse she steals the crew's gold and the compass and gets Konk to help her while Ren chases after her to retrieve the stolen compass.Bloth comes up with a new plan after talking to a soothsaying creature who says that Ren is the only one destined to collect the treasures. He decides to become Ren by swapping bodies with him using a potion made by Morpho. He manages to catch Ren but not without Niddler who he makes Konk swap bodies with to avoid suspicion. The potion has a drawback that any mirror will show their true identities. Ren and Niddler (now in Bloth and Konk's bodies) steal Morpho's potion and escape The Maelstrom to try to get their original bodies back. Things get abit more complicated when Joat shows up to get revenge on Ren(Bloth) and Ioz for stealing The Wraith.Ioz and Tula are arguing yet again and Ren is trying to be the peacemaker as they chase down another treasure. Niddler has gotten separated from the group having gone to raid a nearby freighter for food. The Monkey bird falls asleep and narrowly escapes when the freighter is attacked while passing a strange island and winds up there. The Wraith is not far behind it's the same island where the next treasure is located. Niddler meets a strange but cute little creature while the others run into the Amazon like warriors who live there and are soon captured. The warriors see the creature as a pest but Tula knows what it truly is and tricks the warriors into think she has joined them so she can stay free, rescue Ren and Ioz and save the little creature.On August 31, 2010, Warner Archive released The Pirates of Dark Water: The Complete Series on DVD in region 1 as part of their Hanna–Barbera Classics Collection. This is a Manufacture-on-Demand (MOD) release, available exclusively through Warner's online store and Amazon.com.[2]In November 1991, Marvel Comics produced a comic book series based on the show. Originally intended as a six-part limited series, it was extended to nine issues to include a three-part original story.A series of action figures based on the characters from the show was also produced. The toyline consisted of Ren, Niddler, Ioz, Zoolie, Bloth, Konk, Mantus, Joat, and the Wraith.Pirates of Dark Water video games were also released for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and Sega Genesis systems. The Super Nintendo version was a \"beat 'em up similar to Final Fight, with a slow but strong character (Ioz), a fast but weak character (Tula), and a well-balanced character (Ren). Each character has a life-draining Desperation Attack (spinning kick for Ren, ecomancer energy for Tula, and spinning punch for Ioz) and the ability to block - something not common in games of this genre. The Sega version was a side scrolling platform game with RPG elements.A Pirates of Dark Water role-playing game was released in 1994, but had a limited production run.The Pirates of Dark Water was reviewed favorably in The Scarecrow Video Movie Guide, which contrasted it with other cartoons from the same period, noting that it was \"...serious, well-written, and had a certain amount of craft in its character animation and watercolor backgrounds.\"[3]","title":"","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8d/Darkwaterlogo.jpg/240px-Darkwaterlogo.jpg","developer":"","genre":""},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitfall:_The_Mayan_Adventure","description":"Pitfall: The Mayan Adventure is a 1994 video game developed and published by Activision.

The Japanese arcade release was published by Konami. The graphic animation for the player character(s) and opponents were created through a bluescreen process, where the various poses & moves of the characters were acted out by hired actors in front of a video camera. The game's on-screen character animation are replays of the actual footage, not a rotoscoped (redrawn) animation as was common in other games. Live-action shooting reached a brief highpoint with later arcade titles such as Mortal Kombat and NBA Jam, before gaming trends shifted away. It was the second fighting game to use digitized sprites, after Home Data's Reikai Dōshi: Chinese Exorcist.The gameplay is similar to Taito's Violence Fight and SNK's Street Smart. The player must jump, punch, and kick their opponent until his/her energy runs out. If the player presses all three of the buttons at a time, the character will perform a \"super move\". The player begins Pit-Fighter by choosing one of the three playable characters, who all have different moves, speed, and power.Pit-Fighter features 3 playable fighters:Pit-Fighter also has 8 unplayable opponents. Several of the characters share the names of the actors who played them:An emulated version of the arcade game was featured in the 2004's Midway Arcade Treasures 2 for GameCube, PlayStation 2, and Xbox, as well as Midway Arcade Treasures Deluxe Edition (2006) for Microsoft Windows.

Pit-Fighter was also included in the 2012 compilation Midway Arcade Origins.[8]A prototype of a Pit-Fighter port for the Atari 7800 exists, however it has crudely drawn graphics, no sound and poor collision detection.Computer Gaming World approved of the Amiga version of Pit-Fighter, stating that it \"is the arcade game teleported\", and concluded that the game \"offers the two-player option missing in many fighter games and enough roughhousing to suit the most violent gamer\".[11]In 1992, a fighting game called Guardians of the 'Hood was released by Atari Games. This game featured the same style of digitized characters seen in Pit-Fighter and the player could have 3 other players join simultaneously. The big difference this time around was it played like a scrolling fighter, beat 'em up game and had a completely new cast of characters. Despite its digitized graphics and unique gameplay similar to both Capcom's Final Fight and Sega's Streets Of Rage, this game was overlooked in the arcades and never made it to the home consoles. The game was badly received by critics and gamers alike.","title":"Pit-Fighter","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/61/ATARI_-_PIT-FIGHTER_1990.jpg/220px-ATARI_-_PIT-FIGHTER_1990.jpg","developer":"Atari Games","genre":"Fighting"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plok","description":"Plok is a Super Nintendo game developed by Software Creations and published by Tradewest Games in 1993 in North America, and later by Nintendo in Europe and Activision in Japan. The game is a traditional platform game starring a character named Plok.Plok can launch any of his limbs at will to damage enemies. Once the damage has been done they return to Plok. Some puzzles involve having to \"sacrifice\" one of Plok's limbs to activate switches (thus gradually decreasing Plok's mobility and his chances in battle). Once a limb hits a switch, it is placed on a hanger that may be right next to the switch or several screens away; some switches also require certain limbs. Plok's secondary attack takes the form of a buzzsaw-like jump that not only gives him increased speed, but also dispatches enemies. Plok can pick up shells, which award extra lives and serve as ammunition for a special amulet received partway through the game. The amulet converts shells into power for Plok's secondary attack.Power-ups come in the form of \"presents\" scattered throughout the majority of levels. If Plok locates one of these colorful gifts he is immediately transformed into a more powerful fighting machine for a brief length of time. These power-ups include a flamethrower, boxing gloves, a blunderbuss, dueling pistols and multiple rocket launchers. Specific presents yield vehicles that Plok can use in some later levels in the fleas' lair such as a unicycle, Jeep, jetpack, motorbike, tank, helicopter, Flying saucer and a pair of spring pogo shoes.Plok dwells on Akrillic, a large island in the fictional region of Polyesta. Plok wakes up one morning to find that his big square flag has been stolen. He must travel first to the nearby Cotton Island to retrieve it from the Bobbins Brothers.After vanquishing the Bobbins Brothers, Plok returns to Akrillic to find that the island has been taken over by fleas, large blue creatures that jump around. He quickly learns that the theft of his flag was simply a decoy to lure him away from Akrillic and leave it unguarded. Plok must travel throughout Akrillic, ridding the island of fleas. Partway through the game, Plok takes a break to catch a nap, during which he dreams of Grandpappy Plok's search on Legacy Island for a magical amulet, which is eventually found and stumbled upon by Plok when he awakes.Plok then heads into Plok Town, a thicket, and a cave facing the Penkinos, Womack Spider, and Rocky Fella. After clearing out all the fleas from Akrillic, Plok descends into Brendammi Bog where the fleapit, the source of all the fleas, is located. Riding various vehicles, Plok journeys deep into the Fleapit, ultimately challenging the Flea Queen.Plok grew out of an aborted arcade game called Fleapit. Ste Pickford recounted:The Fleapit game was developed for Rare's custom Razz hardware. It had such an odd (and brilliant) graphics system that it wasn't ever going to be possible to convert the half-finished Fleapit to another platform. We just kept working on the concept and idea after we started at [Software] Creations, looking for an opportunity to get the game made somehow. Toward then [sic] end of Equinox we presented the Plok concept to Rick [Kay, head of Software Creations]. We had our game designs, concept art, and a VHS tape of Fleapit. Rick liked the idea, and it became Software Creations' first self-funded original game, with John and I retaining ownership of the character and IP.[1]The game was presented to Nintendo for publication, and Shigeru Miyamoto expressed strong interest in working on the game. However, Nintendo ultimately decided against publishing Plok. Ste Pickford remarked, \"I suspect Yoshi's Island was in development at the time, and perhaps Mr. Miyamoto decided Plok was too similar for it to be worth working on both.\"[1]In 2009, North American company Super Fighter Team released Zaku, a horizontal shooter for the Atari Lynx which features a special guest appearance by Plok.[2] His appearance in the game was made possible with the official blessing of Ste and John Pickford, creators and copyright holders of the Plok character. The Pickfords later launched a Plok webcomic.[1]Allgame gave Plok a score of 3.5 stars out of a possible 5.[4]","title":"Plok","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/50/Plokbox.jpg/220px-Plokbox.jpg","developer":"Software Creations","genre":"Platform"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pocky_%26_Rocky","description":"Pocky & Rocky, known in Japan as KiKi KaiKai: Nazo no Kuro Mantle (奇々怪界～謎の黒マント?, \"Mysterious Ghost World: The Riddle of the Black Mantle\"), is an arcade-style scrolling shooter video game with an anime graphical style.[7][8] Licensed by Taito to Natsume, who developed and published the game for release in Japan in 1992 and the rest of the world in 1993, it is the sequel to the 1986 arcade game KiKi KaiKai (unofficially released in North America as Knight Boy).[1][9]Pocky & Rocky follows the adventures of a young Shinto shrine maiden named Pocky (known in Japan as Sayo-chan (小夜ちゃん?)) and her new companion, Rocky the Tanuki, or raccoon (known in Japan as Manuke (魔奴化?)) trying to save a group of creatures known as the Nopino Goblins. It was generally well received by critics, and the graphics of the game were especially noted. Pocky & Rocky was followed by Pocky & Rocky 2.Set in a Far East-type of world,[10] Pocky & Rocky is about a young miko[9] girl called Pocky who, while tending to a shrine, is visited by Rocky, a member of a group of creatures known as the Nopino Goblins. Some time ago, the Nopino Goblin went insane, but were stopped and cured by Pocky. Rocky tells Pocky that the Nopino Goblins have gone insane yet again, and that she must help them. Suddenly, Pocky and Rocky are ambushed by the Nopino Goblins, which appear to be under a spell. Together, Pocky and Rocky must unravel the mystery of who is controlling the Nopino Goblins. Throughout the game, they battle a number of creatures from Japanese myth, for instance kappas.[11]Pocky & Rocky is a scrolling shooter type of video game that takes place from a top-down perspective.[8] In a Single-player game the player can choose to control either Pocky or Rocky. In a two-player game both characters are on the screen at the same time.[7] The screen can move either horizontally or vertically and the player-controlled characters can move in eight directions.[1]Pocky & Rocky was generally well received by critics, some calling the gameplay addictive. The two-player mode was considered by some reviewers to add a lot of value to the game. In addition, the controls were considered easy to learn and easy to pick up and play. On the other hand, some reviewers experienced slowdowns in frame rate. The graphics of the game, especially the backgrounds and enemies, received praise for being colorful and well-animated, many comparing it to The Legend of the Mystical Ninja in graphical style. The special effects and weather effects in the game were also well received by reviewers. However, some critics commented the lack of parallax scrolling and Mode 7 effects. The music and sound was positively received, and many critics thought it fitted the theme and setting of the game well.[a]Pocky & Rocky spawned two official sequels and one spiritual successor. In Pocky & Rocky 2 (or Kiki KaiKai: Kayako) for SNES, Pocky and Rocky must work together once again to stop a forced marriage between a princess and a tyrant.[16] In the second sequel, Pocky & Rocky with Becky (Kiki KaiKai Advance) for Game Boy Advance, the duo are joined by their friend Becky to stop a hydra dragon.[17] UFO Interactive Games later released a spiritual successor to the series called Heavenly Guardian, developed by Starfish, for the PS2 and Wii systems.[18]","title":"Pocky & Rocky","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/58/Pocky_%26_Rocky_box.jpg/220px-Pocky_%26_Rocky_box.jpg","developer":"Natsume","genre":"Scrolling shooter"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pocky_%26_Rocky_2","description":"Pocky & Rocky 2, released in Japan as Kiki Kaikai: Tsukiyozoushi (奇々怪界 月夜草子?), is a shoot 'em up video game developed and published by Natsume in Japan and North America, and published in PAL regions by Ocean Software for the Super NES video game console.

In addition, another expansion disk called Populous: The Final Frontier added a single new landscape-type and was released as a cover disk for The One.Populous was released in March 1989, and received almost universal critical acclaim, although Peter Molyneux notes that it was released at the same time as the The Satanic Verses controversy was happening, and that Bullfrog was subsequently contacted by the Daily Mail and warned that the \"good vs evil\" nature of the game would lead to them receiving a similar fatwā (though in fact this did not materialise).[11]The game was reviewed in 1989 in Dragon #150 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in \"The Role of Computers\" column. The reviewers gave the game 5 out of 5 stars.[12] Biff Kritzen of Computer Gaming World gave the game a positive review, noting, \"as heavy-handed as the premise sounds, it really is a rather light-hearted game.\" The simple design and layout were praised, as were the game's colorful graphics.[13] In a 1993 survey of pre 20th-century strategy games the magazine gave the game three stars out of five, calling it a \"quasi-arcade game, but with sustained play value\".[14] MegaTech magazine said the game had \"super graphics and 500 levels. Populous is both highly original and amazingly addictive, with a constant challenge on offer\". Mega placed the game at #25 in their Top Mega Drive Games of All Time.[15]Compute! named the game to its list of \"nine great games for 1989\", stating that with \"great graphics, a simple-to-learn interface, and almost unlimited variety, Populous is a must buy for 1989\".[16] Orson Scott Card in the magazine criticized the game's user interface, but praised the graphics and the ability to \"create your own worlds ... you control the world of the game, instead of the other way around\".[17] The game was voted the 6th best game of all time in Amiga Power.[18]In 1990 Computer Gaming World named Populous as Strategy Game of the Year.[19] In 1991 it won the Origins Award for Best Military or Strategy Computer Game of 1990[20] as well as 1990 Computer Game of the Year in American video game magazine Video Games & Computer Entertainment.[citation needed]In 1990 Bullfrog used the Populous engine to develop Powermonger, a strategic combat-oriented game with similar mechanics to Populous, but with a 3-dimensional graphical interface. In 1991 they developed and released a true sequel, Populous II: Trials of the Olympian Gods, and in 1997 a further direct sequel, Populous: The Beginning.Populous was also released on the SNES gaming console, developed by Imagineer as one of the original titles for the console in Japan,[21] and features the addition of an unlockable race based on the Three Little Pigs.[citation needed]Populous DS, a new version of the game (published by Xseed Games in America and Rising Star Games in Europe), was developed by Genki for the Nintendo DS and released November 11, 2008.[22] The game allows the user to shape the in-game landscape using the DS's stylus. It also features a multiplayer mode allowing four players to play over a wireless connection.[23]Populous has been re-released through Good Old Games and on Origin through the Humble Origin Bundle sale. It runs under DOSBox.The browser-based game Reprisal, was created in 2012 by Electrolyte and Last17, as an homage to Populous.[24]Godus (formerly Project GODUS) was revealed as a URL on the face of Curiosity – What's Inside the Cube?, and \"is aimed to reimagine\" Populous.[25]","title":"Populous","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/7e/Populous_cover.jpg/220px-Populous_cover.jpg","developer":"Bullfrog","genre":"real-time strategy"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Populous_II:_Trials_of_the_Olympian_Gods","description":"Populous II: Trials of the Olympian Gods is a 1991 strategy video game in the Populous series for the Amiga, Atari ST and MS-DOS-based computers, developed by Bullfrog Productions.

The Power Instinct or Gouketsuji Ichizoku series (often abbreviated as PI or GI for short) is renowned for its more humorous take on fighting games, its music and its often-weird characters.[citation needed]One of the innovations unique to the series was the introduction of the transformation feature. Several of the characters can change their appearance and fighting style by simply executing certain moves (usually a throwing move), though this has not been featured in every entry in the series. Other features include the ability to perform a double jump and attacking while dashing.The first game of the series was released in 1993. In it, players play as a member of the Goketsuji clan, who are battling to determine who will replace 78-year old Oume Goketsuji as head of the clan. It has eight selectable characters and one unplayable boss character, Oume Goketsuji, a palette-swap of her younger sister Otane. Originally, every character had a specific win quote for each defeated foe, but that was reduced to only one win quote for each character in the English version.This game was ported to Super Nintendo and Sega Mega Drive/Genesis and included some new play modes: Vs. Battle, Practice Mode, Time Attack and a \"Life Attack\" that consists of defeating as many opponents as possible with just one life bar (similar to the Survival Modes seen in other fighting games).The Mega Drive version has a Battle Royal mode where 1 or 2 players can select a team, with an option to hide the characters being chosen and they would not be revealed until during gameplay. Additionally, it featured an option that allowed the strength of each special attack of every playable character to be adjusted to the player's liking.The English console ports of this game had several omitted features, such as Karaoke Mode with the lyrics for the songs \"Tatanka no Uta\" and \"Otoko no Karatemichi\", character biographies that popped up in between demos, the intro demo to the game and the scene of Oume where she speaks to the player before she fights them (which changes if she's fighting Otane).Another difference between the American Super Nintendo and Japanese Super Famicom versions are the endings; the Super Nintendo version replaces them with a Congratulations screen with the character portraits used in the pre-fight screen, while in the latter the endings are still present, though slightly different from those in the original arcade version, drawn in a style similar to the endings found in Power Instinct 2.[citation needed]Power Instinct 2 features five new characters, giving a total of 13 playable characters and one unplayable boss (Otane Goketsuji). The PlayStation version, retitled Gouketsuji Ichizoku 2: Chotto Dake Saikyou Densetsu, was only released in Japan and has some characteristics from Gogetsuji Legends (as it shares almost the same subtitle to its Japanese version), like the team battle and the possibility to play as Chuck and Kuroko, but these features are only available for Versus (player vs. player) mode. The game's story picks off from the last game, with Otane having defeated her sister Oume in the previous tournament. However, with the help of their mother Oshima Goketsuji, Oume kidnapped her sister, threw her into the ocean, and forged a letter saying that Otane has quit as leader, resulting in a new tournament. Otane does escape and fights the winner of the tournament in a bid to defend her leadership of the Goketsuji clan. Unlike the arcade game, anytime a transformable character changed into his or her alternate version in the Playstation port, there was considerable loading time that interrupted the match.The game introduces the \"Stress\" meter into the series, which increases when one's attacks are blocked or when attacked. A super attack can be executed when it is full. In addition, when the Stress meter fills up, a character becomes engulfed in a flame of their own energy for a brief moment, which protects from any incoming attacks from the opponent and knocks them away if they are too close.On release, Famicom Tsūshin scored the PlayStation version of the game a 23 out of 40.[1]Known as Gouketsuji Gaiden: Saikyou Densetsu in Japan, the third installment was called Gogetsuji Legends outside Japan, lacking the Power Instinct title, strangely enough. This would be a trend for the series in its subsequent western releases, officially phasing out the Power Instinct branding. The game's story picks up from the last game, with Otane being defeated by Kanji Kokuin, who became the new leader of the Gouketsuji clan.The battles are in teams of two characters, a leader and a partner. Super Kurara and Pochi are individual characters; because of this, Kurara and Kinta gained new moves. Otane is also made playable, bringing the cast to 16 characters. A Super Block and a Charge Attack were brought into the gameplay. A Super Block can nullify the opponent's blow and allow for a counterattack, and a Charge Attack can immediately knock down the opponent or launch them into the air for another attack. There is one new playable character, (Kuroko), and a new boss, (Chuck). All of the characters were given new special attacks. However, the majority of them were exclusive only to this game.The story of this sequel of the series, known as Gouketsuji Ichizoku 3: Groove on Fight in Japan, takes place 20 years after the last Goketsuji tournament. It also has a darker and more serious tone than its predecessors, similar to that of Garou: Mark of the Wolves, but still maintains a little of the same humor that is particular to the series.The players can choose from eleven characters, all of them, save Otane/Oume, being new. The graphic style of Groove on Fight is very different from its predecessors, as the sprites are smaller, but are more fluid and have an animated look to them.The Sega Saturn port of the game included some features like being able to play as Damian, Bristol Weller and Bristol-D once the player beats the game with certain characters, the possibility of four players to play at the same time by way of the Saturn's multi-tap and an \"Omake Mode\" where the players can view artwork of the characters for the game.The Saturn version also features an arranged version of the soundtrack that has some new music themes that were not present in the original, like the theme \"Mystic\" and the vocal version of the title song.Gameplay is in a 2-on-2 format with the ability to tag in and out at any time between players. Every time the player tag successfully between characters, the character who is on the sidelines slowly begins to get his or her energy back.At difference from the previous games, Groove on Fight has a six buttons system. The two new buttons are for \"Dodge\" and for the \"Powerful Blow\" the \"Dodge\" allows the characters to evade attacks and then counterattack the opponent.The \"Powerful Blow\" is an attack that inflicts more damage to the opponent than the normal strong attacks, but is also slower. The special guard and the shadow moves from Gogetsuji Legends are still present in the game and some other new characteristics were introduced to the gameplay:This new sequel, called Shin Gouketsuji Ichizoku: Toukon Matrimelee in Japan, features 4 totally new characters and one new boss (Princess Sissy). However, Angela does not return in this game. Jimmy, Elias, Lynn and Jones from Rage of the Dragons are guest stars, and are unlockable. A few of the game elements were borrowed from this same game as well. The western releases drop the Shin Gouketsuji Ichizoku title and remains named simply as Matrimelee. It was one of the last few games to be released on the Neo Geo.Transformations were excluded, and a few of the characters from the previous sequel do not appear. The Stress meter now could be filled up to three levels. Every character has a Stress Shot (1 bar), an Ippatsu Ougi (2 bars) and a powerful, hidden super attack called a Kinjite (3 bars). However, only a few of the Kinjite moves are known; information on the rest have not been released by Atlus or Noise Factory.In the game's story, the king of Certain Country wants to find a worthy successor for the throne and the ideal husband for his little daughter (or a beautiful and strong woman for his older son) So he holds a fighting tournament where the prize is the hand of the princess and the throne succession.The sequel of Matrimelee was released exclusively in Japan. It features enhanced graphics and sound, the return of two of the older characters (Angela Belti and Kinta Kokuin), a new boss, and the return of the transformation feature. Gameplay was also improved in some areas, and super attacks were made easier to execute. The game has the same backgrounds and all the characters from Matrimelee, and because of that it is usually described as a port of the game, while in fact the game's story takes place after the events from the previous game, making it a sort of sequel or update. The game tells the story of the king from the previous game, who holds a \"Bonnou Kaihou\" (\"Liberation of Lusts\") tournament to cheer up his daughter Princess Sissy. This time the prize is anything that the winner could wish for (except the throne succession).The game also features an online mode and a 'Lust Cards System' that consists of buying cards with special effects. Some allow the player to change certain characteristics of the characters, others are used to view special music video clips, and others to call strange characters to help the player in battle.This 2009 sequel picks up the story of the Goketsuji clan, with Oume announcing a new tournament. Several new characters were introduced:Various merchandise based on the series has been released in Japan. The 253-page 1995 novel Gouketsuji Ichizoku: The Novel (ISBN 978-4-8470-3158-8) was published by Wani Books in 1995. It relates the history of the Goketsuji family and features some art made by Range Murata. Gouketsuji Ichizoku: THE CD-ROM was published in 1998 by Toshiba EMI and contains information about the series including characters profiles, correlation diagrams, the family lineage, concept art, sounds and other artwork. It also has desktop wallpapers and screen savers.Soundtracks to the first five games in the series were also released. Pony Canyon/Scitron released the first four, while Noise Factory released the Matrimelee soundtrack. In 2005, Noise Factory released a box set of all soundtracks to the first five games in the series, along with a 2005 calendar featuring art from the. Unlike the original releases, the CDs in the box art do not include the sound effects collections and the Groove on Fight's CD has the arranged tracks from the Sega Saturn.","title":"","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a2/Groove_on_Fight_%28insert%29.png/250px-Groove_on_Fight_%28insert%29.png","developer":"Atlus","genre":"2D Versus fighting"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Moves","description":"Power Athlete (パワーアスリート?), known outside of Japan for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis as Deadly Moves or for the Super NES as Power Moves, is a 1992 fighting video game developed by System Vision and published by Kaneko.

The game takes place in a post-apocalyptic version of Earth called \"Urth\". Players control one of seven large beasts that battle each other to determine the fate of the planet. Matches feature many of the conventions of fighting games from the era, including special moves and gory finishing maneuvers.Toys, comics, a novel (Primal Rage: The Avatars by John Vornholt) and other merchandise tie-ins were also produced.Seven fearsome creatures emerge from their slumber deep within the Urth's crust, and become worshiped as gods by the humans, who form segregated clans beneath the ones they worship. The beasts themselves are divided between those who wish to keep peace on Urth, and those who attempt to plunge the world into further chaos for their own benefit. These creatures have otherworldly or supernatural abilities. The Primal Rage trading cards that were distributed along with the toyline presented each creature as a god of an aspect of nature, as in life and death, fire and ice. There are four of the good Virtuous gods and three evil Destructive gods. The character Sauron, God of Hunger, is marked as a \"Virtuous Beast\" despite the fact that his in-game ending displays an image of him devouring humans. In fact, the creatures eating humans is a basic part of the gameplay.Primal Rage is a traditional two-dimensional fighting game in which two players select characters to battle each other in one-on-one combat, or a single player finishes a campaign of fights against the CPU, over increasing difficulty. The final battle of the single-player game consisted of fighting all the other CPU monsters with an increased power bar, made available in a mini-game prior to the fight. A total of seven characters are available for players to select from (as listed below). Each character has his or her own specialized set of three attack moves and abilities. In the game, the object is to deplete the opposing character's health meter as fast as possible. If \"Game Gore\" (an option on some consoles) is switched on, then a defeated character's heart will explode into a bloody mess, and their brain will dissolve to ashes.Unlike most fighting games, where the special moves are performed by moving the joystick followed by pressing one or more buttons, Primal Rage features a system where the player holds down certain buttons, then performs the joystick movements. Later revisions of the arcade game added the ability to perform \"special moves\" in the more traditional way, with motion followed by button presses, but kept the original method as well. After the opponent is defeated, a brief moment is allowed for the player to perform a fatality that finishes the adversary in a more dramatic fashion; these were performed in a similar manner to the special moves. Although all characters feature three finishing moves, some of them were more easter eggs than fatalities, such as Vertigo's \"La Vache Qui Rit\" (French for \"the laughing cow\"), a fatality in which Vertigo transforms her opponent into a cow, which moos and runs away.As with other bloody U.S. based fighting titles of the time (most notably Mortal Kombat), Primal Rage sparked considerable controversy due to its violence level, depicting gory fatalities and the live devouring of humans. Though it was a bloody game, Primal Rage was rated \"T\" for Teen. To appease the critics, the game was withdrawn, re-programmed and re-released several times.[citation needed] Later arcade incarnations of \"Primal Rage\" included a \"Gore/No Gore\" toggle switch which, when flipped to the \"No Gore\" setting, disabled the use of Fatalities, the eating of humans, and all of the game's blood.[citation needed]Ellie Rovella of Gilbert, Arizona launched a grass-roots campaign against the game after her 11-year-old son bought and played the Genesis version of Primal Rage and executed Chaos' golden shower/urination fatality. The campaign resulted in Best Buy pulling the game from 251 stores nationwide.[2] In response, Primal Rage publisher Time Warner Interactive pointed out that Rovella never complained to Time Warner themselves, instead taking the issue directly to the media, and that the game was clearly rated \"T\" for Teen and so should not have been purchased by her 11-year-old son in the first place.[2]Primal Rage is notable for several things:Primal Rage was released for most game systems of its time. It was released for both CD-ROM and cartridge-based consoles. The PlayStation port has long loading times, a 3D intro, and fewer frames of animation for each character than the arcade version. Combo names are displayed like the arcade version. The Sega Saturn port is much like the PlayStation, except the sprites are larger and have more colours. The loading times are similar. This port features 3D intros of one character with narration whenever facing them in Arcade Mode. Combo names are absent. There was an early alpha of this port released onto the internet. The 3DO version is much like the Saturn one, except it lacks the 3D cutscences, intro, and shadows. Also, it has much smaller sprites. The Jaguar CD release is based on the 3DO version, except it has short loading times.Primal Rage was also released for various computers. The DOS ports feature different sound effects, larger sprites and all the frames of animation from the arcade version. The game CD included three different editions of the game, one for systems with 4 MB RAM, another for 8 MB and one for 16 MB, each with increasing fidelity to the arcade game. The Amiga version features 8-bit characters, and smaller sprites, giving players big spaces to move around. There are also new sound effects and screen-shaking effects. Although it was marketed as an Amiga 1200 version, this version was in fact suitable for any Amiga with at least 2MB chip Ram.[3]The Primal Rage design team implemented an unusual and largely unknown security method into the arcade machine's coding that prevented the full features of the game from becoming active. Since the original programming team has since moved on to other things, and some of the programmers even departed the electronic entertainment business altogether, they could not be reached for questioning regarding the game's security lock-outs. Those who have been contacted expressed no interest in unlocking the ROM BIOS for freeware distribution or security corrections. For these reasons, no perfect emulation of the original arcade game exists.By 1995, Atari had begun production of Primal Rage II. The game, however, was never released even though a test arcade cabinet briefly appeared playable at the Golf Land arcade in Sunnyvale, California. Necrosan, a boss in the form of a living dragon skeleton, once rumored by video game magazine Gamepro to be added in a future release of the original Primal Rage, was to become the main antagonist.Much anticipation centered around the upcoming game, however the game did not get very far into production as Atari felt that the game wouldn't generate enough sales. They later announced the cancellation though not many people knew about it. After that, Primal Rage's popularity died down. A supposedly finished machine of this was shown at the California Extreme 2001 show. The machine had the original board and most of the original art. In subsequent years, screen shots of the incomplete game have been released on the Internet. Also, the characters of Slash Fang and Necrosan were released with the other god characters in the short-lived Primal Rage action figure series. On December 2012, a YouTube user posted a video that showcased the almost never-before seen game in action, and then in June 2014, video game news site Joystiq reported that the game was available for play at Galloping Ghost Arcade in Brookfield, Illinois.[4]Although the game never came to be, its story was later adapted into Primal Rage: The Avatars.When Primal Rage II was cancelled, Atari allegedly felt it necessary to somehow present the story for the sequel in one form or another. Thus, in 1997, a novel called Primal Rage: The Avatars, written by John Vornholt, was published by Boulevard Books. The book tells what happened to the dinosaur gods 65 million years ago, and then moves into the main story of the gods' reign on Urth renewed, then the beast Necrosan appears. The book also focuses on fleshing out the world of Primal Rage, and does so by bringing \"the Avatars\" to the forefront of the story, they being the humans chosen by their respective gods to be their shamans or other titles of nobility.A number of details to the backstory of Primal Rage are made clear in The Avatars. According to John Vornholt's novel the events in Primal Rage take place in the year 1000 AC (After Cataclysm) or about the year 3000 AD according to the Gregorian calendar. The battles of the dinosaurs are referred to as \"The Primal Rage\". In the novel, the spell used to imprison the dinosaur gods is called the Bonds of Forbidding. Necrosan the skeletal dragon (who is referred to as Necronus on the introductory page) reactivates the Bonds of Forbidding to entrap the gods.When the Primal Rage video game was out, there were also action figures made for the creatures of Primal Rage each including their own follower.","title":"Primal Rage","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f7/Primal_Rage_flyer.jpg","developer":"Atari Games","genre":"Fighting"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_of_Persia_(1989_video_game)","description":"Prince of Persia is a fantasy platform game, originally developed by Jordan Mechner and released in 1989 for the Apple II, that represented a great leap forward in the quality of animation seen in video games.For the Japanese computer ports, Arsys Software[6] and Riverhillsoft[7] enhanced the visuals and redesigned the Prince's appearance, introducing the classic turban and vest look that was featured in later Prince of Persia ports and games by Brøderbund.[7]Computer Gaming World stated that the game package's claim that it \"breaks new ground with animation so uncannily human it must be seen to be believed\" was true. It concluded that Prince of Persia \"captures the feel of those great old adventure films ... a tremendous achievement\", and compared its impact on gaming to Star Wars on film.[20] The New York Times described the Macintosh version as having \"brilliant graphics and excellent sound ... Sure, you could do all this years ago on a Commodore 64 or Atari 400. But those games never looked or sounded like this\".[21] Reviewing the Genesis version, GamePro praised the \"extremely fluid\" animation of the player character and commented that the controls are difficult to master but nonetheless very effective. Comparing it to the SNES version, they summarized that \"the Genesis version has better graphics, and the SNES has better music. Otherwise, the two are identical in almost every way ...\"[22] Electronic Gaming Monthly likewise assessed the Genesis version as \"An excellent conversion of the classic action game\", and added that the game's challenging strategy and technique give it high longevity.[17]Despite critical acclaim, the game was initially a commercial failure in North America, where it had sold only 7,000 units each on the Apple II and IBM PC platforms by July 1990. It was when the game was released in Japan and Europe that year that it became a commercial success. In July 1990, the NEC PC-9801 version sold 10,000 units as soon as it was released in Japan. It was then ported to various different home computers and video game consoles, eventually selling 2 million units worldwide by the time its sequel Prince of Persia 2: The Shadow and the Flame (1993) was in production. Prince of Persia would go on to influence cinematic platformers such as Flashback as well as action-adventure games such as Tomb Raider.[7]In 2007, Prince of Persia was remade and ported by Gameloft. The remake, titled Prince of Persia Classic, was released on June 13, 2007 to the Xbox Live Arcade, and on October 23, 2008 on the PlayStation Network. It features the same level design and general premise but contained 3D-rendered graphics, more fluid movements, and Sands of Time aesthetics.[24] The gameplay and controls were slightly adjusted to include a wall-jump move and different swordplay. New game modes were also added, such as \"Time Attack\" and \"Survival\".[25] The game has also been released on Android.[26]On April 17, 2012, Jordan Mechner established a GitHub repository[30] containing the long-thought-lost original Apple II source code for Prince of Persia.[31][32] A technical document describing the operation of this source code is available on Mechner's website.[33]","title":"Prince of Persia","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/80/Prince_of_Persia_1989_cover.jpg","developer":"Brøderbund","genre":"Cinematic platformer"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_of_Persia_2:_The_Shadow_and_the_Flame","description":"Prince of Persia 2: The Shadow and the Flame is a platform game released by Brøderbund in 1993.","title":"Prince of Persia 2: The Shadow and the Flame","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/ac/Pop2-saf.JPG","developer":"Brøderbund","genre":"Cinematic platformer"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Quarterback","description":"Pro Quarterback is a 1992 multiplatform video game that is based on American football.

It is a 2D action game with puzzle elements that uses \"isometric\" graphics to create a pseudo-3D effect, and serves as a precursor to the isometric platformer genre. The object is to change the color of every cube in a pyramid by making the on-screen character hop on top of the cube while avoiding obstacles and enemies. Players use a joystick to control the character.The game was conceived by Warren Davis and Jeff Lee. Lee designed the title character and original concept, which was then further developed and implemented by Davis. Q*bert was developed under the project name Cubes, but was briefly named Snots And Boogers and @!#?@! during development.Q*bert was well received in arcades and among critics. The game was Gottlieb's most successful video game and among the most recognized brands from the golden age of arcade video games. It has been ported to numerous platforms. The success resulted in sequels and the use of the character's likeness in merchandising, such as appearances on lunch boxes, toys, and an animated television show. The character Q*bert became known for his \"swearing\", an incoherent phrase of synthesized speech generated by the sound chip and a speech balloon of nonsensical characters that appear when he collides with an enemy.Because the game was developed during the period when Columbia Pictures owned Gottlieb, the intellectual rights to Q*bert stayed with Columbia even after they divested themselves of Gottlieb's assets in 1984. Therefore, it is currently a property of Sony Pictures Entertainment when its parent Sony acquired Columbia in 1989. Q*bert appeared in Disney's Wreck-It Ralph, under a license from Sony, and will appear again in the upcoming live-action comedy Pixels in 2015.Q*bert is an action game with puzzle elements played from an axonometric third-person perspective to convey a three-dimensional look.[1] The game is played using a single, diagonally mounted four-way joystick.[2] The player controls Q*bert, who starts each game at the top of a pyramid made of 28 cubes, and moves by hopping diagonally from cube to cube. Landing on a cube causes it to change color, and changing every cube to the target color allows the player to progress to the next stage.[3]At the beginning, jumping on every cube once is enough to advance. In later stages, each cube must be hit twice to reach the target color. Other times, cubes change color every time Q*bert lands on them, instead of remaining on the target color once they reach it. Both elements are then combined in subsequent stages. Jumping off the pyramid results in the character's death.[4]A collision with purple enemies is fatal to the character, whereas the green enemies are removed from the board upon contact.[2] Colored balls occasionally appear at the second row of cubes and bounce downward; contact with a red ball is lethal to Q*bert, while contact with a green one immobilizes the on-screen enemies for a limited time.[4] Multicolored floating discs on either side of the pyramid serve as an escape from danger, particularly Coily. When Q*bert jumps on a disc, it transports him to the top of the pyramid. If Coily is in close pursuit of the character, he will jump after Q*bert and fall to his death, awarding bonus points.[2] This causes all enemies and balls on the screen to disappear, though they start to return after a few seconds.The basic ideas for the game were thought up by Warren Davis and Jeff Lee. The initial concept began when artist Jeff Lee drew a pyramid of cubes inspired by M. C. Escher.[6] Lee felt a game could be derived from the artwork, and created an orange, armless main character. The character jumped along the cubes and shot projectiles, called \"mucus bombs\", from a tubular nose at enemies.[7] Enemies included a blue creature, later changed purple and named Wrong Way, and an orange creature, later changed green and named Sam.[8] Lee had drawn similar characters since childhood, inspired by characters from comics, cartoons, Mad magazine and by artist Ed \"Big Daddy\" Roth.[9] Q*bert's design later included a speech balloon with a string of nonsensical characters, \"@!#?@!\",[Note 1] which Lee originally presented as joke.[8]Warren Davis, a programmer hired to work on the action game Protector,[6] noticed Lee's ideas, and asked if he could use them to practice programming randomness and gravity as game mechanic. Thus, he added balls that bounced from the pyramid's top to bottom.[8] Because Davis was still learning how to program game mechanics, he wanted to keep the design simple. He also felt games with complex control schemes were frustrating and wanted something that could be played with one hand. To accomplish this, Davis removed the shooting and changed the objective to saving the protagonist from danger.[9] As Davis worked on the game one night, Gottlieb's vice president of engineering, Ron Waxman, noticed him and suggested to change the color of the cubes after the game's character has landed on them.[6][8][9] Davis implemented a unique control scheme; a four-way joystick was rotated 45° to match the directions of Q*bert's jumping. Staff members at Gottlieb urged for a more conventional orientation, but Davis stuck to his decision.[6][8] Davis remembered to have started programming in April 1982,[10] but the project was only put on schedule as an actual product several months later.[Note 2]A MOS Technology 6502 chip that operates at 894 kHz generates the sound effects, and a speech synthesizer by Votrax generates Q*bert's incoherent expressions.[11] The audio system uses 128B of random-access memory and 4KB of erasable programmable read only memory to store the sound data and code to implement it. Like other Gottlieb games, the sound system was thoroughly tested to ensure it would handle daily usage. In retrospect, audio engineer David Thiel commented that such testing minimized time available for creative designing.[12]Thiel was tasked with using the synthesizer to produce English phrases for the game. However, he was unable to create coherent phrases and eventually chose to string together random phonemes instead. Thiel also felt the incoherent speech was a good fit for the \"@!#?@!\" in Q*bert's speech balloon. Following a suggestion from technician Rick Tighe, a pinball machine component was included to make a loud sound when a character falls off the pyramid.[6][8] The sound is generated by an internal coil that hits the interior of a cabinet wall. Foam padding was added to the area of contact on the cabinet; the developers felt the softer sound better matched a fall rather than a loud knocking sound. The cost of installing foam, however, was too expensive and the padding was omitted.[9]As development neared the production stage, Q*bert underwent location tests in local arcades under its preliminary title @!#?@!, before being widely distributed. According to Jeff Lee, his oldest written record attesting to the game being playable as @!#?@! in a public location, a Brunswick bowling alley, dates back to September 11, 1982.[8] Gottlieb also conducted focus groups, in which the designers observed players through a two-way mirror.[8] The control scheme received a mixed reaction during play testing; some players adapted quickly while others found it frustrating.[8][9] Initially, Davis was worried players would not adjust to the different controls; some players would unintentionally jump off the pyramid several times, reaching a game over in about ten seconds. Players, however, became accustomed to the controls after playing several rounds of the game.[8] The different responses to the controls prompted Davis to reduce the game's level of difficulty—a decision that he would later regret.[9]A copyright claim registered with the United States Copyright Office by Gottlieb on February 10, 1983 cites the date of publication of Q*bert as October 18, 1982.[14] Video Games reported that the game was sold directly to arcade operators at its public showing at the AMOA show held November 18–20, 1982.[15] Gottlieb offered the machines for $2600 per unit.[16] Q*bert is Gottlieb's fourth video game.[17]Q*bert was Gottlieb's only video game that gathered huge critical and commercial success, selling around 25,000 arcade cabinets.[6] Cabaret and cocktail versions of the game were later produced. The machines have since become collector's items; the rarest of them are the cocktail versions.[18]When the game was first introduced to a wider industry audience at the November 1982 AMOA show, it was immediately received favorably by the press. Video Games placed Q*bert first in its list of Top Ten Hits, describing it as \"the most unusual and exciting game of the show\" and stating that \"no operator dared to walk away without buying at least one\".[15] The Coin Slot reported \"Gottlieb's game, Q*BERT, was one of the stars of the show\", and predicted that \"The game should do very well.\"[19]Contemporaneous reviews were equally enthusiastic, and focused on the uniqueness of the gameplay and audiovisual presentation. Roger C. Sharpe of Electronic Games considered it \"a potential Arcade Award winner for coin-op game of the year\", praising innovative gameplay and outstanding graphics.[3] William Brohaugh of Creative Computing Video & Arcade Games described the game as an \"all-round winner\" that had many strong points. He praised the variety of sound effects and the graphics, calling the colors vibrant. Brohaugh lauded Q*bert '​s inventiveness and appeal, stating that the objective was interesting and unique.[17] Michael Blanchet of Electronic Fun suggested the game might push Pac-Man out of the spotlight in 1983. [2] Neil Tesser of Video Games also likened Q*bert to Japanese games like Pac-Man and Donkey Kong, due to the focus on characters, animation and story lines, as well as the \"absence of violence\".[7] Computer and Video Games magazine praised the game's graphics and colors.[5]Electronic Games awarded Q*bert \"Most Innovative Coin-op Game\" of the year.[20] Video Game Player called it the \"Funniest Game of the Year\" among arcade games in 1983.[21]Q*bert continues to be widely recognized as a significant part of video game history. Author Steven Kent and GameSpy's William Cassidy considered Q*bert one of the more memorable games of its time.[22][23] Author David Ellis echoed similar statements, calling it a \"classic favorite\".[24] 1UP.com's Jeremy Parish and Kim Wild of Retro Gamer magazine described the game as difficult yet addictive.[8][25] Author John Sellers also called Q*bert addictive, and praised the sound effects and three-dimensional appearance of the graphics.[13] Cassidy called the game unique and challenging; he attributed the challenge in part to the control scheme.[23] IGN's Jeremy Dunham felt the controls were poorly designed, describing them as \"unresponsive\" and \"a struggle\". He nonetheless commented that the game was addictive despite the controls.[26]The main character also received positive press coverage. Edge magazine attributed the success of the game to the title character. They stated that players could easily relate to Q*bert, particularly because he swore.[9] Computer and Video Games, however, considered the swearing a negative, but still felt the character was appealing.[5] Cassidy believed the game's appeal lay in the main character. He described Q*bert as cute and having a personality that made him stand out in comparison to other popular video game characters.[23] The authors of High Score! referred to Q*bert as \"ultra-endearing alien hopmeister\", and the cutest game character of 1982.[27]At the 1982 AMOA Show, Parker Brothers secured the license to publish home conversions of the Q*bert arcade game.[28] Parker first published a port to the Atari 2600,[29] and by the end of 1983, the company also advertised versions for Atari 5200, Intellivision, ColecoVision, the Atari 8-bit computer family, Commodore VIC-20, Texas Instruments TI-99/4A and Commodore 64.[30] The release of the Commodore 64 version was noted to lack behind the others[29] but appeared in 1984.[31] Parker Brothers also translated the game into a stand-alone tabletop electronic game.[32] It uses a VFD screen, and has since become a rare collector's item.[33] Q*bert was also published by Parker Brothers for the Philips Videopac in Europe,[34] by Tsukuda Original for the Othello Multivision in Japan,[35] and by Ultra Games for the NES in North America.[36]Other home versions were well-received for the most part, with some exceptions. Of the ColecoVision version, Electronic Fun with Computers & Games noted that \"Q*bert aficionados will not be disappointed\".[41] Marc Brownstein of Video Games called it one of the best of the authorized versions.[29] Warren Davis also considered the ColecoVision version the most accurate port of the arcade.[8] Mark Brownstein judged the Atari 5200 version inferior to the ColecoVision, due to the imprecision of the Atari 5200 controller, but noted that \"it does tend to grow on you.\"[29] Video Games determined the Intellivision version as the worst of the available ports, criticizing the system's controller for being inadequate for the game.[42] Antic magazine's David Duberman called the Atari 8-bit version \"one of the finest translations of an arcade game for the home computer format\",[43] and Arthur Leyenberger of Creative Computing listed it as a runner-up for Best Arcade Adaptation to the system, praising its faithful graphics, sound, movement and playability.[44] Softline was more critical, criticizing the Atari version's controls and lack of swearing. The magazine concluded that \"the home computer game doesn't have the sense of style of the one in the arcades ... the execution just isn't there\".[45] In 1984 the magazine's readers named the game the fifth-worst Atari program of 1983.[46] Computer Games called the C64 version an \"absolutely terrific translation\" that \"almost totally duplicates the arcade game,\" aside from its lack of synthesized speech.[31] The stand-alone tabletop was awarded Stand-Alone Game of the Year in Electronic Games.[20]On February 22, 2007, Q*bert was released on the PlayStation 3's PlayStation Network.[52] It features upscaled and filtered graphics,[25] an online leaderboard for players to post high-scores, and Sixaxis motion controls.[26] The game received a mixed reception. Dunham and Gerstmann did not enjoy the motion controls and felt it was a title only for nostalgic players.[26][53] Eurogamer.net's Richard Leadbetter judged the game's elements \"too simplistic and repetitive to make them worthwhile in 2007\".[54] In contrast, Parish considered the title worth purchasing, citing its addictive gameplay.[25]According to Jeremy Parish, Q*bert was \"one of the higher-profile titles of the classic era\".[25] In describing Q*bert '​s legacy, Jeff Gerstmann of GameSpot referred to the game as a \"rare arcade success\".[53] In 2008, Guinness World Records ranked it behind 16 other arcade games in terms of their technical, creative and cultural impact.[55] Despite its success, the creators of the game did not receive royalties, as Gottlieb had no such program in place at the time.[8] Davis and Lee nonetheless expressed pride about the game continuing to be remembered fondly.[8]Q*bert became one of the most merchandised arcade games behind Pac-Man,[8] although according to John Sellers it was not nearly as successful as that franchise or Donkey Kong.[13] The character's likeness appears on various items including coloring books, sleeping bags, frisbees, board games, wind-up toys, and stuffed animals.[8][13][23] In a flyer distributed in 1983, Gottlieb claimed over 125 licensed products.[16] However, the North American video game crash of 1983 depressed the market, and the game's popularity began to decline by 1984.[8][23]In the years following its release, Q*bert inspired many other games with similar concepts. The magazines Video Games and Computer Games both commented on the trend with features about Q*bert-like games in 1984. They listed Mr. Cool by Sierra On-Line, Frostbite by Activision, Q-Bopper by Accelerated Software, Juice by Tronix, Quick Step by Imagic, Flip & Flop and Boing by First Star Software, Pharaoh's Pyramid by Master Control Software, Pogo Joe by Screenplay, Rabbit Transit by Starpath, as games which had been inspired by Q*bert.[29][56] Further titles that have been identified as Q*bert-like games include J-bird by Orion Software,[57] Cubit by Micromax,[58] and in the UK Pogo by Ocean,[59] Spellbound by Beyond[60] and Hubert by Blaby Computer Games.[61]In 1983, Q*bert was adapted into an animated cartoon as part of CBS's Saturday Supercade, which features segments based on video game characters from the golden age of video arcade games. Saturday Supercade was produced by Ruby-Spears Productions, the Q*bert segments between 1983 (1983)–1984 (1984).[62] The show is set in a United States, 1950s era town called \"Q-Burg\",[63] and stars Q*bert as a high school student, altered to include arms and hands.[23] He also has the ability to shoot black projectiles from his nose. Characters frequently say puns that add the letter \"Q\" to words.[63] Aside from Q*bert and the known game villains, the cartoon also includes new characters similar to Q*bert in appearance and naming.[64]Q*bert, Coily, Ugg, Slick, and Sam appear in the 2012 Disney animated film Wreck-It Ralph.[65] They start out as \"homeless\" video game characters living in Game Central Station after their game was unplugged and taken out of Litwak's Arcade. Ralph gives them a cherry from Pac-Man as a gesture of kindness. After Ralph takes Markowski's uniform in Tapper's, he accidentally trips over Q*bert on his way to Hero's Duty. This leads Q*bert to go to Fix-It Felix Jr. to warn Felix that Ralph has \"gone Turbo.\" In that scene, Felix apparently speaks \"Q*bert-ese.\" At the end of the film, Ralph and Felix decide to let Q*bert, Coily, Ugg, Slick, Sam, and the generic homeless video game characters into Fix-It Felix Jr., suggesting that they help out in the bonus levels where Coily, Ugg, Slick, Sam, and the generic video game characters assist Ralph in wrecking the building while Q*bert assists Felix in fixing it.[66]In July 2014, Sony Pictures announced Q*bert to appear in the upcoming film Pixels, which is scheduled for May 15, 2015.[67]Q*bert can be seen being played in the 1984 film Moscow on the Hudson starring Robin Williams. The film was produced by Columbia Pictures.[10] The 1993 IBM PC role-playing game Ultima Underworld II: Labyrinth of Worlds features a segment where the player has to solve a pyramid puzzle as an homage to Q*bert.[68] In the 2009 action-adventure game Ghostbusters: The Video Game, a Q*bert arcade cabinet can be seen in the Ghostbusters HQ. However, the game is merely decoration and not playable.[69]More recently, the game or its characters have been referenced in several animated television series. In the Family Guy episode \"Chick Cancer\", Stewie reflects on how it was easier being Q*bert's room mate and an animation of him on the game board is shown.[70] In \"Anthology of Interest II\" of Futurama, he is one of the aliens that attack to invade earth in a segment of video game parodies.[71] In The Simpsons episode \"In the Name of the Grandfather\" Marge, Bart and Lisa hop around the stones of the Giants Causeway in a game of Q*bert.[72][73] The Robot Chicken episode \"Sushi Rolls\" is in general a Street Fighter parody, but in the end M. Bison is shown inside the game Q*bert.[74] In Mad: \"James Bond: Reply All\", Q*bert is seen at the MI6 lab.[75] Q*bert also appeared on the battlefield in South Park: \"Imaginationland: Episode III\".[76]On November 28, 1983, Rob Gerhardt reached a record score of 33,273,520 points in a Q*bert marathon.[77] He held it for almost 30 years, until George Leutz from Brooklyn, NY played one game of Q*bert for eighty-four hours and forty-eight minutes on February 14–18, 2013 at Richie Knucklez' Arcade in Flemington, NJ.[78] He scored 37,163,080 points.[79] Doris Self, credited by Guinness World Records as the \"oldest competitive female gamer\",[80] set the tournament record score of 1,112,300 for Q*bert in 1984 at the age of 58. Her record was surpassed by Drew Goins on June 27, 1987 with a score of 2,222,220.[81] Self continuously attempted to regain the record until her death in 2006.[8]Believing that the original game was too easy, Davis initiated development of Faster Harder More Challenging Q*bert (also known as FHMC Q*bert) in 1983,[9] which increases the difficulty, introduces a new enemy named Q*bertha and adds a bonus round.[82] The project, however, was canceled and the game never entered production.[8] Davis later released FHMC Q*bert '​s ROM image onto the web.[8] Gottlieb also released a pinball game, Q*bert '​s Quest, based on the arcade version. It features two pairs of flippers in an \"X\" formation and audio from the arcade.[8][83] Gottlieb produced fewer than 900 units.[83]Several video game sequels were released over the years, but did not reach the same level of success as the original.[8][23] The first, titled Q*bert's Qubes, shows a copyright for 1983 on its title screen,[13] whereas the instruction manual cites a 1984 copyright.[84] It was manufactured by Mylstar Electronics,[Note 3] and uses the same hardware as the original.[85] The game features Q*bert, but introduces new enemies: Meltniks, Soobops, and Rat-A-Tat-Tat.[86] The player navigates the protagonist around a plane of cubes while avoiding enemies. Jumping on a cube causes it to rotate, changing the color of the visible sides of the cube.[13] The goal is to match a line of cubes to a target sample; later levels require multiple rows to match.[87] Despite the popularity of the franchise, the game's release was hardly noticed.[13] Parker Brothers showcased home versions of Q*bert's Qubes at the Winter Consumer Electronics Show in January 1985.[86] Q*bert's Qubes was ported to the Colecovision and Atari 2600.[88][89]Konami, who had distributed the original Q*bert to Japanese arcades in 1983,[90] produced a game with the title Q*bert for MSX computers in 1986, released in Japan and Europe. However, the main character is a little dragon, and the mechanics are based on Q*bert's Qubes. The player once again turns around colored cubes by jumping from cube to cube, trying to reach the displayed target pattern. Contrary to Mylstar's arcade game, each of the 50 stages has a different pattern of cubes, in addition to the known rule extensions in later stages. The game also features a competitive 2-player mode, where each side is assigned a different pattern, and the players can score points either by completing their pattern first, or by pushing the other off the board.[91]Q*bert 3 for the SNES was also developed by Realtime Associates and released in 1992.[93] Jeff Lee, creator of the Q*bert character, also worked on the graphics for this game.[10] Q*bert 3 features gameplay similar to the original, but like the Game Boy game, it has larger levels of varying shapes. In addition to enemies from the first game, it introduces several new enemies (Frogg, Top Hat, and Derby).[94][95]In 2004, Sony Pictures released a remake/sequel for Adobe Flash titled Q*bert 2004, containing a faithful rendition of the original arcade game, along with 50 levels that use new board layouts and six new visual themes.[99] Q*Bert Deluxe for iOS devices was initially released as a rendition of the arcade game, but later received updates with the themes and stages from Q*Bert 2004.[100]In 2005, Sony Pictures released Q*bert 2005 as a download for Windows[101] and as a Flash browser applet,[citation needed] featuring 50 different levels.[101]On July 2, 2014 Gonzo Games and Sideline amusement announced Q*bert Rebooted to be released on Steam, iOS and Android.[102] The title contains a port of the classic arcade game alongside a new playing mode that uses hexagonal shapes. It adds seven variants of the Q*bert character and three new enemy types. According to Mark Caplan, Vice President, Consumer Products, Worldwide Marketing & Distribution at Sony Pictures Entertainment, the release was motivated by \"renewed interest in Q*bert, in part due to the cameo in the recent Wreck It Ralph animated feature film\".[103]","title":"Q*bert","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/7c/Q%2Abert_arcade_cabinet.jpg","developer":"Gottlieb","genre":"Action"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_Drivin%27","description":"","title":"Race Drivin'","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/29/Race_Drivin_arcade_flyer.jpg","developer":"Atari Games","genre":"Driving simulation"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_Rex","description":"Radical Rex is a 1 or 2-player platforming video game released in 1994 for North America, Europe and Australia.

It was the first game in the Raiden series of scrolling shooter arcade games. Raiden was released in September 1990. The game was distributed in Japan by Tecmo, North America by Fabtek, Taiwan by Liang HWA Electronics, Korea by IBL Corporation, Hong Kong by Wah Yan Electronics, and a few other countries such as Malaysia, though the publishers in those countries are unknown.The title in Japanese translates to \"Thunder And Lightning\". Rai means thunder, and den means lightning. The closest English approximation of the pronunciation is /ˈraɪdɛn/ RY-den. \"Raiden\" is the name of a Japanese WWII Fighter.In the year 2090, Earth has suddenly become the target of deranged aliens known as the Cranassians. Following the invasion, the World Alliance Military builds a new cutting-edge weapon, the Raiden Supersonic Attack Fighter. Based on a captured alien craft, it is humanity's only hope for survival.Raiden consists of eight vertical scrolling missions where the player maneuvers the Raiden craft dodging and destroying enemy robots, buildings, ground targets, and aircraft. There are bombs and missile powerups as well as collectable medals which add to the score. When player dies, the fighter's fragments become projectiles that damage enemies.Raiden was ported to the FM Towns Marty, PC Engine, Atari Jaguar, Atari Lynx, Amiga (prototype, never released), MS-DOS, and the mobile phone. The MS-DOS port was coded by Nigel 'Freddy' Conroy, Steve Cullen and Martin Randall, and was spearheaded by Martin Hooley. There also exist port of game for Atari Falcon made by Imagitec Design.Raiden Trad is a spin-off of the original game for Super FC/Super NES, Sega Mega Drive/Genesis and FM Towns.The Raiden Project, originally released in Japan as simply Raiden Project (雷電プロジェクト?) is a port of the arcade games Raiden and Raiden II to the PlayStation. It was also a launch title for the system released September 9, 1995. This would be the only time that Raiden II would be released on a console. The game is an arcade perfect port (hence Project), not emulated, probably because emulating this game on PS1 hardware is not feasible.The original Raiden (not the Raiden Project) is available as a download from the Japanese PlayStation Network store. The downloadable version can be played on the PlayStation 3 console or PlayStation Portable.A Raiden/Raiden II soundtrack was published by INH CO.,LTD. It includes soundtracks from Raiden (arcade, PlayStation), Raiden II (arcade, PlayStation), Raiden DX (arcade) and Raiden Densetsu (FM Towns), as well as a booklet; Go Sato liner note; gallery.Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the Atari Jaguar version an average of 6 out of 10. Their four reviewers agreed that it was virtually identical to the arcade version, but were divided about the quality of the game itself. Two of them described Raiden as \"above average\", and two described it as mediocre, saying that the ship moves too slow, enemy fire often blends in with the background, and the graphics are subpar given the Jaguar's capabilities.[1] GamePro similarly criticized that the gameplay is outdated, the ship moves too slow, and that the graphics do not live up to the Jaguar's potential. They concluded that \"A snoozer like Raiden just seems out of place on a powerful system like the Jaguar.\"[2]Due to the success of Raiden, several sequels and related games were made.","title":"Raiden","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/6b/Raiden_arcadeflyer.png/256px-Raiden_arcadeflyer.png","developer":"Seibu Kaihatsu","genre":"scrolling shooter"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rampart_(video_game)","description":"Rampart is an arcade game, released in 1990 by Atari Games, that combines the shoot 'em up and puzzle genres.In Rampart, the player is in control of a set of castles, which they must defend, by alternately shooting at attacking ships (or other players), and repairing any damage done to them within a time limit. Surrounding this castle is a wall, made up of small blocks, completely surrounding a region of the board. This area is considered the player's territory, and it may contain one or more castles, and any number of cannons. The maintenance of this territory is the primary focus of the game. Once the player defeats the opponent, the player can execute the commander, by walking the plank or beheading.Within Rampart each element of the game interacts with the others in subtle ways. It is generally easier to capture an unowned castle than repair the wall around a starting castle, but without the benefit of the home castle’s cannons the player will have a tough time. Building close to the water will allow the player better aim, and to get more shots off during battle (each cannon may only have one cannonball in the air at once), but enemy ships will also get more shots and castles close to the water are more vulnerable to grunts. Building more cannons gives the player more shots in battle, but once placed cannons cannot be removed, and too many cannons can make it almost impossible to survive a repair phase. These tradeoffs give Rampart its charm but also make the game difficult to master.Rampart has been ported to the SNES, Sega Master System, Mega Drive/Genesis, Atari Lynx, PC, Macintosh, Commodore 64, Amiga and Atari ST platforms, separate versions for Game Boy and Game Boy Color, and also separate versions for the Nintendo Entertainment System and the Famicom. MegaTech gave the Mega Drive version 90% and a Hyper Game Award, saying that it was a \"superb blend of different game styles\".[1]The arcade version of Rampart is also included in the Midway Arcade Treasures compilation, available for the Nintendo GameCube, PlayStation 2, Xbox and PlayStation Portable consoles, and the Midway Arcade Origins compilation, available for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.[2] It was also included with Gauntlet on the Game Boy Advance.Most of the home versions of Rampart change the game in non-trivial ways. The Japanese (NES) Famicom version, which released by Konami, includes 7 training levels and 3 difficulty settings. It also features an extensive multiplayer mode for two people. Many options can be chosen, such as number of cannons to start with and so on.There are also several open-source games based on the gameplay of Rampart, such as Kajaani Kombat and Castle Combat.Games based on Rampart are also available for iOS devices, such as Zen Wars and Hostile Tides.[3]Rampart influenced the first tower defense games around a decade later. Gameplay similarities include defending a territory by erecting defensive structures, and making repairs between multiple rounds of attacks.[4][5]","title":"Rampart","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/37/Rampart_Cover.jpg/250px-Rampart_Cover.jpg","developer":"Atari Games","genre":"Strategy"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranma_%C2%BD:_Hard_Battle","description":"Ranma ½: Hard Battle (らんま1/2 爆烈乱闘篇, Ranma ½: Bakuretsu Rantōhen?)

It features gameplay similar to Midway's earlier Terminator 2: Judgment Day. In the game, players battle the oppressive New Order Nation regime and their leader Helga, who have abducted Aerosmith. Players use a mounted gun to control onscreen crosshairs and shoot enemies using compact discs. The members of Aerosmith are hidden throughout the game's international locales and must be found in order to receive the game's true ending.Revolution X is a rail shooter in which the player has to shoot targets including NON soldiers and vehicles, with the ultimate goal of rescuing the band. Players start the game at Club X in Los Angeles, first fighting the NON troops inside and then stealing a helicopter to fly across the city and find Aerosmith's car. They must then destroy three NON facilities in Amazon jungle, the Middle East and Pacific Rim. These stages may be played in any order; however, failing to complete the Middle East stage within a set time limit will send the players back to its start for another attempt until the bus is destroyed. Finally, the players advance to Wembley Stadium for the final battle with Helga and the surviving NON forces. Throughout the game, objects can be shot that may reveal power-ups like health-replenishing shakes, CDs, powerful laserdiscs and Super Guns, Skull Bombs and shields. Players can also find hostages and free them throughout the game for extra points.[4]Mortal Kombat II features an advertisement with the old Revolution X logo that arcade operators could toggle on and off.[5] Occasionally after a large in-game explosion, Steven Tyler can be heard saying \"Toasty!\" in a high-pitched voice in reference to an easter egg in Mortal Kombat II. The game was originally developed as a title based on the film Jurassic Park. However, Sega acquired the rights instead and eventually released its own arcade game based on the film. Midway then retooled its concept to revolve around Aerosmith.[6]The first release labeled Proto 5.0 (5/23/1994) is lacking several speech samples spoken by members of Aerosmith, has a shorter Pacific Rim level, and features the old Aerosmith logo. Revision 1.0 (6/16/1994) restored the missing speech samples and has the complete Pacific Rim level and completed the both new crosshair in P2 and P3 and the current Aerosmith logo. Revolution X was released as upright two player and deluxe three player arcade units and as a conversion kit for existing gun games such as Terminator 2: The Arcade Game.[7]Another Revolution X featuring the hip-hop group Public Enemy was considered, but reportedly scrapped after the negative reception that the home versions of the original Revolution X received.[6]Sega Saturn Magazine gave the Saturn version a 44% and summarized it as \"An incredibly bland and monotonous game matched only by the blandness and monotony of the band that endorse it\", citing overlong boss fights and a lack of intelligent design to where the enemies appear.[12] IGN gave the PlayStation version a 1 out of 10. They complained of slow controls and poor graphics and concluded that \"Revolution X isn't the worst game ever made, but it sure comes close.\"[8]","title":"Revolution X","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e3/RevolutionX_arcadeflyer.png/220px-RevolutionX_arcadeflyer.png","developer":"Midway","genre":"Shooting gallery"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rex_Ronan:_Experimental_Surgeon","description":"Rex Ronan: Experimental Surgeon is a Super Nintendo Entertainment System video game published by Raya Systems that teaches players about the hazards of smoking tobacco cigarettes.[2][3] The initial development of the game received support from the US Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.[4] The game is part of a series of healthcare-related educational video games by Raya that included Captain Novolin, Packy and Marlon and Bronkie the Bronchiasaurus.","title":"Rex Ronan: Experimental Surgeon","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/1f/RexRonanCoverArt.jpg/220px-RexRonanCoverArt.jpg","developer":"Sculptured Software","genre":"Edutainment"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riddick_Bowe_Boxing","description":"Riddick Bowe Boxing (リディック･ボウ ボクシング, Boxing Ridikku Bou?) is a multiplatform boxing video game released in 1993.

It was ported to numerous home console and computer formats, and was also released as an arcade game cabinet.Rise of the Robots was announced early in development, and generated considerable buzz for its advanced graphics. On release it became notorious in the video gaming industry for myriad crippling gameplay problems. Today it is generally considered one of the least successful and most critically reviled fighting games of its time.[1]Rise of the Robots uses full motion video sequences for the opening cutscene, the introduction of each opponent, and the destruction of each opponent. On cartridge-based versions of the game, the opening cutscene is omitted and the other FMVs are replaced with short pre-rendered animations confined to a small rectangle in the center of the screen. In the Sega Genesis and Amiga CD32 versions, the destruction sequences use only a static screen shot. In addition, due to space limitations the FMVs were heavily edited for the PC, Amiga CD32, and CD-i versions; the complete FMV sequences appear only in the 3DO version.While Rise of the Robots received many accolades for its state-of-the-art graphic design, it was almost universally panned by video game critics who found it highly frustrating.[citation needed] Many were unimpressed by the game's challenging controls. There were not many moves or combos available to the player, and many reviews pointed out that each android had a very small set of standard actions, causing the action to quickly become dull and repetitive.[citation needed] GamesRadar staff named it the 100th worst video game ever made. They discussed the propensity of bad 2D fighting games in the 90's, and criticized its \"aged\" rendered 3D graphics, poor character balance, poor combo system, and difficulty spikes.[2]In particular, the vast majority of computer opponents could be defeated by repeated use of a simple flying kick. Amiga Power described how review copies had only been released to the press a few days before the game went on sale, and concluded by stating that \"it's probably because the graphics are [so] good that the game plays so poorly – every move the robots make takes so many frames of animation, and so much memory, and so many months of rendering with 3D Studio, that it simply wouldn't have been possible to make the gameplay any more complicated than it is.\"[3] Davies highlighted a number of flaws, including the fact that the players could not turn around, the limited sound effects and music, and the static background graphics. Game Informer declared Rise of the Robots the worst game of 1994.[citation needed]A major issue was that the characters in the single player mode were positioned in order of mounting difficulty and the same character traits were kept in the multiplayer mode. This meant that the characters were improperly balanced in versus mode; some androids could inflict massive damage blows while others could inflict only minor damage. Because of this, Rise of the Robots was unable to contend with the more popular fighting titles of the time such as Mortal Kombat or Street Fighter. It did, however, receive a highly controversial 91% score from Computer and Video Games.","title":"Rise of the Robots","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/59/Rise_of_the_Robots_Coverart.png/220px-Rise_of_the_Robots_Coverart.png","developer":"","genre":"Fighting game"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rival_Turf!","description":"Rival Turf!, released in Japan as Rushing Beat (ラッシング・ビート?), is a beat'em up video game that was released by Jaleco in 1992 for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and later on the Wii Virtual Console.

RoboCop centers on a police officer that is brutally murdered and subsequently re-created as a super-human cyborg, otherwise known as a \"RoboCop\". Two sequels followed with video games done for each film.RoboCop was released in 1988 by Nihon Bussan/AV Japan.[1] In the game, a player controls RoboCop who advances through various stages that are taken from the 1987 movie. The bonus screen is a target shooting range that uses a first-person perspective. The intermission features digitized voices from the actors.RoboCop was licenced by UK-based Ocean Software at the script stage, so (fairly uniquely for the time) the 1988 run & gun and beat 'em up hybrid arcade game developed and published by Data East and Nihon Bussan,[2] was licensed from a computer game company rather than the other way around. This is why the arcade game bears a licence credit for Ocean.Several reworked versions appeared for home computers and video game consoles, most of them handled by Ocean, as well as a NES version ported by Sakata SAS and published by Data East. It has more recently appeared on mobile phones. The IBM and Apple ports were produced by US-based Quicksilver Software. Unlike the other home versions, the Commodore 64 version is a mostly original game that only loosely follows the arcade RoboCop. In addition to a different soundtrack, the boss battles are replaced with a screen where the player must shoot a man holding a woman hostage (without hitting her). The original European cassette tape version was notorious for a huge number of bugs (which were cleaned up in the US disk release).The games capture the spirit of the RoboCop film to some degree, as it involves killing generic criminals and enemy bosses, like the dangerous ED-209. Being quite popular, RoboCop was followed by several sequels (most of them handled by Ocean), including RoboCop 2, RoboCop 3, and RoboCop versus The Terminator which was developed for, but never released in arcades, and was later ported to several other consoles including the Sega Mega Drive, Super NES, Nintendo Game Boy, Sega Game Gear, and even as a final generation title for the Sega Master System in Europe.The ZX Spectrum version of RoboCop achieved particular critical success, receiving a CRASH Smash award from CRASH,[9] 94% in Sinclair User[5] and Your Sinclair gave 8.8 out of 10,[10] also placing it at number 94 in the Your Sinclair official top 100. The overall opinion was that this game was better than the original arcade game. Its capture of the original material, smooth scrolling and animation, sampled speech and sound effects were highlighted.In addition, the ZX Spectrum RoboCop was one of the biggest selling games of all time on that platform and was number one in the sales charts for over a year and a half.[11] It entered the charts in April 1989, and was still in the top five in February 1991.[12] The readers of YS voted it the 9th best game of all time.[13]RoboCop 2 is a series of video games published in the 1990s by Ocean and Data East for various home computers and video game consoles. They are based on the movie of the same name. Three different games were produced, each produced on two systems.The version for the Commodore 64 and NES was a simple left-to-right scrolling platformer, in which RoboCop was required to collect/destroy at least two-thirds of the drug \"nuke\" in each level and arrest two-thirds of the suspects by running into them (in contrast to shooting them). If RoboCop does not manage to attain the required amounts of nuke or number of arrests then he has two chances in the game to prove his efficiency at a shooting range. If he succeeds, he may continue onto the next level. If he fails, or if both chances at the shooting range are already used up, he must repeat the level.There was also an arcade-only version of RoboCop 2, developed and published in 1991 by Data East (who still held the rights to create arcade games based on the franchise), which allowed up to two players at once (one controlling the original RoboCop, the other controlling a slightly purple-hued clone). The game followed the basic premise of the movie, but had some major sequential differences.[14]It was a mostly side-scrolling shoot-em-up, with some levels viewed from behind RoboCop and providing a targeting reticle with which to kill generic criminals. Compared to all RoboCop 2 games, it features the most advanced graphics.RoboCop 3 is a 1993 video game published by Ocean. It is based on the movie of the same name. The NES edition of RoboCop 3 is a traditional single-player, side-scrolling game with a storyline and background that loosely follows the film. A unique, memorable feature is the fact that each of RoboCop's body parts has a separate damage rating. Heavily damaged parts can result in \"malfunctions,\" such as erratic firing (if the arm holding the weapon is damaged) or difficulty walking (if legs are damaged). The player has the opportunity to repair RoboCop's parts between levels. Within PAL-A regions, it was only released in Italy.[17]The Super NES edition of RoboCop 3 is also a traditional single-player side-scrolling game. It was developed by Ocean Software and had what many considered to be extremely difficult gameplay. It was largely critically panned upon release. Flying Edge (a subsidiary of Acclaim Entertainment) would later port this version to the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis, Sega Master System and Sega Game Gear.The Amiga version comes with a choice of three languages: English, French and German. There are two game modes \"Movie Adventure\" that follows a story-line and \"Arcade Action\" where the player can choose between five different single levels. The \"Movie Adventure\" mode opens up with a cut-scene (the cut-scenes are made with subtitled 2D panels and movies with a mix of 2D and 3D graphics) where a newscasts details how the building of the new Delta City is creating a new class of homeless people and a wave of crime by a new gang called \"Splatterpunks\". A new police unit named \"Rehabs\" have been set up in response to this, headed by Mac Daggart (named differently from his counterpart in the film, whose name is Paul McDagget. Also, the CEO is still The Old Man from the previous films). The newscast then reports of a hostage situation in the city and the game cuts to the action where RoboCop is in pursuit of a stolen van. The player (represented by a green dot on the ingame map) is to stop the van (represented by an orange dot) by ramming it with his police car. If approached from the rear, the residents of the van will open fire lowering the health (called \"Efficiency\" in the game) of the player. Other obstacles include civilian cars on the road, terrain and buildings. After the van has been stopped the player's next goal is to assist officer Lewis inside an apartment building (represented by a white dot on the ingame map). The controls for driving the car are the keyboard cursor keys and the mouse. Somewhat different from most other racing games is the fact that no loss of speed occurs when turning only when moving the steering wheel.RoboCop Versus The Terminator was released for a number of platforms and based on the RoboCop and Terminator franchises.In the future, human soldiers of John Connor's resistance force against the machines are fighting a losing war against Skynet and its robot forces. Discovering that one of the foundation technologies for Skynet is the cybernetics technology used in the creation of cyborg police officer RoboCop, Flo, a resistance soldier, is sent back in time to destroy RoboCop and stop Skynet from being built. However Skynet learns of the time travel attempt and sends Terminators to stop Flo.In the game, the player controls RoboCop, who may move across the screen, jump, fire and exchange weapons. RoboCop starts with the Auto-9 which has unlimited ammunition. Other weapons may be more powerful and carry unlimited ammunition as well. Beginning the game on a mission of law enforcement, RoboCop soon meets up with Flo and must engage in battle against Terminators, the forces of OCP and several obstacles. Upon discovering one of the Terminators has infiltrated the OCP building, RoboCop plugs himself into a console to reprogram the security, only to fall into a trap and be digitized. After his body is disassembled and used for building Skynet, RoboCop watches Skynet come to power before using his digitized mind to seize control of an abandoned robotics factory, rebuild himself, and begin to destroy Skynet in the future.RoboCop(titled RoboCop: Aratanaru Kikiin Japan) is a 2003 first person shooter released for the sixth generation home consoles. The only North American version available was released for the Xbox while the PAL region versions were released on all consoles except for Game Boy Advance.[18] A Japan-only version was released on GameCube. This was Titus Software's last game they developed, before they went bankrupt in 2005.The game allows the player to play as RoboCop and to uncover a sinister plot involving OCP, local gangsters dealing a deadly new synthetic drug and a powerful cyborg known only as MIND. As a last hope, RoboCop must capture, destroy, or arrest hostile characters in a desperate search for clues and evidence.","title":"RoboCop","developer":"Data East","genre":"Side-scroller"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RoboCop_Versus_The_Terminator","description":"RoboCop Versus The Terminator is a video game released for a number of platforms and is based on the RoboCop and Terminator franchises.","title":"RoboCop Versus The Terminator","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/5a/Robocop_versus_Terminator_cover.jpg","developer":"Virgin Games USA","genre":"Action"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotrek","description":"Robotrek (released under the title of Slapstick (スラップスティック, Surappusutikku?) in Japan) is a role-playing video game released in 1994. It was published by Enix and developed by Quintet and Ancient for the SNES video game console.As its Japanese name implies, Robotrek was intended as a humorous game. Designed to appeal to a younger audience,[1] Robotrek's main focus is on allowing the player to raise up to three robots which are built from spare parts that may be found, gained through battles, or generated by the player by means of the game's item combination system. Next Generation describes it as a predecessor to the core idea of Pokémon in the sense that the protagonist does not himself fight, but sends out his robots to do so. Like Pokémon, each robot was kept in a ball.[1]Robotrek has similar gameplay to that of most RPG video games, with the notable exception that the main character is not the combatant; rather, the robots he invents are, making it more similar to Pokémon and Dragon Quest Monsters. The robots are highly customizable, in aspects such as equipment, special attacks, body color and name. The player is allowed to build a maximum of three robots. Unlike many RPGs, the player must invent or create the robots equipment, use \"Program Points\" to set the robot's attributes (as opposed to these attributes being set by the game), and program special attacks in a macro-like fashion, although certain commands do special effects instead.","title":"Robotrek","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a3/Robotrekboxart.jpg/220px-Robotrekboxart.jpg","developer":"Quintet","genre":"Role-playing video game"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_n%27_Roll_Racing","description":"","title":"Rock n' Roll Racing","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/ef/Rock_N%27_Roll_Racing_Cover.jpg/250px-Rock_N%27_Roll_Racing_Cover.jpg","developer":"Silicon & Synapse","genre":"Racing"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocketeer#Computer_games","description":"Starslayer #1 (cameo)\n(February 1982)The Rocketeer is a fictional character, a superhero created by writer-illustrator Dave Stevens. The character first appeared in 1982 and is an homage to the Saturday matinee serial heroes of the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s.[2]The Rocketeer is the secret identity of Cliff Secord, a stunt pilot who discovers a mysterious jetpack that allows him to fly. His adventures are set in Los Angeles and New York in 1938, and Stevens gave them a retro, nostalgic feel influenced by the King of the Rocket Men movie serial, the syndicated Commando Cody TV series (both from Republic Pictures), and pinup diva Bettie Page.[3]In 1991, The Rocketeer was released as a feature film by Walt Disney Pictures and was directed by Joe Johnston. Rocketeer creator Dave Stevens has a small cameo in the film as the German test pilot who dies when the Nazi version of a rocket backpack explodes during take-off. This was a part of black-and-white film footage stolen, then smuggled to the US of Nazi top secret rocket backpack testing.In 1938 Los Angeles, Cliff Secord, a local racing pilot and barnstormer, discovers a mysterious package hidden by two gangsters, who were fleeing the police. In that package, Cliff finds what the police were looking for: a stolen rocket-pack prototype.The Rocketeer makes a great number of references to pop culture from the 1930s to the 1950s. The first storyline, \"The Rocketeer\" features characters from the Doc Savage pulp series, though Stevens takes care not to refer to any of the characters — including Doc Savage himself — by name, so as not to violate copyright and incur a licensing fee for use of the characters. \"Cliff's New York Adventure\" similarly features unnamed characters from The Shadow pulp magazine series, including the Shadow's famous alter ego, Lamont Cranston.Besides pulp characters, actors of the 1940s and 1950s have also visually inspired two characters: Lothar, the villain in \"Cliff's New York Adventure\", is based on the likeness of acromegalic horror movie star Rondo Hatton;[4][5] and Cliff Secord's girlfriend Betty is modeled after \"Queen of Pinups\" Bettie Page.[3]A \"Rocket Man\" character, with a near-identical rocket backpack and similar uniform, appeared in four Republic Pictures movie serials from 1949 through 1953. The fourth serial, originally conceived as a syndicated Republic TV series, was first released under contractual obligation to movie houses as a regular multi-chapter theatrical serial; two years later, it was re-cut with new footage and additional music added and finally syndicated on NBC television stations as twelve 25-minute episodes.The four Republic Rocket Man serials were:Other influences on the Stevens' character include Buck Rogers, the short-lived comic series Lars of Mars by Jerry Siegel and Murphy Anderson,[7][8] as well as Adam Strange, also inked by Murphy Anderson.The Rocketeer's first adventure appeared in 1982 as a backup feature in issues #2 and #3 of Mike Grell's Starslayer series from Pacific Comics. Two more installments appeared in Pacific's showcase comic Pacific Presents #1 and 2. The fourth chapter ended in a cliffhanger that was later concluded in a special Rocketeer issue released by Eclipse Comics.[9] The complete story was then collected by Eclipse in a single volume titled The Rocketeer (ISBN 1-56060-088-8). It was published in three versions: a trade paperback edition, a trade hardcover, and a signed, limited edition hardcover. Noted fantasy author Harlan Ellison, a fan of the Rocketeer and also an acquaintance of Dave Stevens,[citation needed] wrote the introduction to the collection; both Dave Stevens and Harlan Ellison signed the limited edition on a specially bound-in bookplate.The story was continued in the Rocketeer Adventure Magazine. Two issues were published by Comico Comics in 1988 and 1989; the third installment was not published until 1995, six years later by Dark Horse Comics. All three issues were then collected by Dark Horse into a glossy trade paperback titled The Rocketeer: Cliff's New York Adventure (ISBN 1-56971-092-9) that quickly went out-of-print.On February 28, 2009, IDW Publishing announced a hardcover collecting the entire series for the first time, intended to be published in October 2009. Dave Stevens' The Rocketeer, The Complete Adventures contained new coloring by Laura Martin, who had been chosen by Dave Stevens prior to his death.[10] The book appeared in December, two months later than announced, in two versions: A standard trade hardcover edition with full color dust jacket and a second, more lavish, deluxe edition (ISBN 978-1600105371), limited to 3000 hardcover copies. The deluxe edition used different Stevens artwork for its dust jacket and was issued in an illustrated, all color slipcase; it also had full color illustrated endpapers. While the deluxe contains the same Rocketeer comics reprints as the trade edition, it adds more than 130 pages of previously uncollected Rocketeer material: sketches, preliminaries, character designs, script pages, photographs, and original art pages, with commentaries by Dave Stevens and several peers who occasionally assisted him on The Rocketeer. The deluxe edition sold out almost immediately upon publication, but IDW announced a second printing.IDW debuted the first issue of a brand new Rocketeer comics series, Rocketeer Adventures, in May 2011. Issue #1 featured work from John Cassaday, Mike Allred, Kurt Busiek, and Michael Kaluta, plus pin-ups by Mike Mignola, Dave Stewart, and Jim Silke. The four 2011 issues offered regular and variant cover designs by both Alex Ross and Dave Stevens; various black and white Retailer Incentive variants were also published in limited press runs; several additional variant issues by Jet Pack Comics, featuring recolored Dave Stevens artwork, were also published in limited press runs. To celebrate the launch of this all-new Rocketeer series, IDW's Hundred Penny Press also simultaneously released a $1.00 re-issue of the original The Rocketeer #1 by Dave Stevens, fully remastered and recolored by Eisner-winner Laura Martin. The first four Rocketeer Adventures issues were then collected in 2011 into a hardcover graphic novel, followed by second hardcover graphic novel in 2012 that collected the next four issues: A color Rocketeer title logo was used on the regular retail copies of the graphic novel, plus one additional Retailer Incentive hardcover without a title logo printed on its dust cover; both versions were offered with the same Alex Ross' color artwork.A second IDW four-issue miniseries of Rocketeer adventures, Rocketeer: Cargo of Doom, began appearing in 2012. Each issue offered a regular retail cover design and one alternate Retailer Incentive cover. In addition publisher Jet Pack Comics issued several additional Retailer Incentive variants with Dave Stevens re-colored artwork reprinted on their covers. The miniseries was then collected as two variant graphic novel hardcovers, one offered with a regular dust jacket, the other without.A third IDW four-issue miniseries of Rocketeer adventures, Rocketeer: Hollywood Horror, began appearing in late February 2013. As with the previous series, each issue offered a regular retail cover design and one Retailer Incentive alternate cover. The miniseries was then collected as two variant hardcover graphic novel editions, one with a regular style dust jacket, the other without.A fourth IDW Rocketeer miniseries, Rocketeer and The Spirit: Pulp Friction, began appearing in the summer of 2013, as another limited four-issue miniseries. As with the two previous Rocketter miniseries, each issue offered a regular retail cover design and one Retailer Incentive alternate cover. A special San Diego Comic Con International promotional variant issue #1, with a black and white wraparound cover, was offered only at the 2013 convention. The miniseries was then collected by as a hardcover graphic novel and proved to be the final Rocketeer comic series released by IDW.In September, 2014, IDW issued The Rocketeer: Jet-Pack Adventures, a prose anthology of ten short stories written by authors including Yvonne Navarro, Don Webb, Gregory Frost, Nancy Holder, Nancy A. Collins, and others. These stories cover the adventures of the Rocketeer from 1939 through 1945.[11]The Rocketeer film was briefly mentioned in the web series Underbelly during their \"Who is the Best James Bond\" episode. The series, consisting of Frank Patterson, Shawn Cappel, Newt Wallen, and Justin Silverman, featured Newt Wallen failing to adequately explain how Timothy Dalton was the best James Bond among all the actors who had portrayed the character. Frank, Shawn, and Justin mocked him for choosing Dalton at the last minute. Newt tried, unsuccessfully, to justify his comment by pointing out that Dalton was a good actor in The Rocketeer feature film.IGN listed the Rocketeer as the 76th Greatest Comic Book Character, stating that the Rocketeer taps into that popular desire to fly; IGN also stated the Rocketeer saga remains a compelling one.[19]","title":"","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/91/Rocketeer_Adventure_Magazine_1.png/250px-Rocketeer_Adventure_Magazine_1.png","developer":"","genre":""},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocko%27s_Modern_Life:_Spunky%27s_Dangerous_Day","description":"","title":"Rocko's Modern Life: Spunky's Dangerous Day","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b2/RockosModernLifeSpunkysDD.jpg/220px-RockosModernLifeSpunkysDD.jpg","developer":"Viacom New Media","genre":"2D action"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky_Rodent","description":"Rocky Rodent is a video game for Super Nintendo Entertainment System, released in 1993.

The series was released in Japan during the height of the media franchise's popularity. By 1998, twenty games were released.[1] The games released as of 1995, each had sales figures of about 200,000 to 300,000.[2] They have never been released in any other country, with the single exception of the Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon game developed by Angel, which was released in France in 1994.[3] The games are hard to find in any other country unless downloaded from the internet as ROMs.Bandai produced a small number of Sailor Moon games, but the majority were handled by a Japanese game company called Angel. Early games were side-scrolling fighters, whereas later games were unique puzzle games, and even later titles chose to go a versus fighting game style. Another Story was the only game to stand out, being a role-playing video game. Panic in Nakayoshi World was also released, an overhead Adventures of Lolo-style puzzle game featuring characters from various Nakayoshi-printed manga. Sailor Moon and Chibi Moon are playable characters.The games mainly saw release on the Super Famicom, with the first side-scroller being ported to the Mega Drive. A separate arcade side-scrolling fighter was also released. In addition, two side-scrolling adventure games were produced for the Game Boy (Sailor Moon and Sailor Moon R), and a side-scrolling game was also produced for the Game Gear (Sailor Moon S).The last Sailor Moon-related game to date was released in November 2001 - Happy Chibiusa World.A game was released in the U.S. for the PC. It was a minigame compilation titled The 3D Adventures of Sailor Moon. Aside from the theme, the games did nothing to tie in to the series.On July 15, 2010, Bandai Namco Games Europe announced development of a new Sailor Moon video game for Nintendo DS, Sailor Moon: La Luna Splende, an adventure game featuring environmental puzzles that takes place in Molly/Naru's dreams.[4]Sailor Moon (美少女戦士セーラームーン, Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon) is a beat 'em up video game developed by Angel in 1993, and ported to the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. It was translated into French in 1994. The Sega Mega Drive version was developed and published by Ma-Ba, although certain elements were recycled from the Super Famicom version.The game is set in the first series of Sailor Moon, and the player takes control of one or two of the five heroines. Each Senshi has some sequences of blows, three aerial attacks (neutral, moving forward/backward, downward) and a special charge-up projectile.A sequel was produced to the first Sailor Moon game which introduced a new playable character, Chibiusa. Unlike other Sailor Moon games, Sailor Moon R was developed and published by Bandai, instead of Angel. The sprites from the previous game were redesigned with more detail and more animation frames for this game and the later games. Like the Mega Drive version of the previous game, the bosses have their own theme music. By playing the game on hard mode, there is a minor change to the ending that involves Sailor Pluto.Pretty Soldier Sailor Moon S - Jougai Rantou!? Shuyaku Soudatsusen is a fighting game developed by and published by Angel and released on December 1994.Pretty Soldier Sailor Moon S is a 2D fighting game for the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer, featuring nine Sailor senshi (Sailor Saturn is not present) and based on Sailor Moon S season. Each Senshi has a set of special attacks. Virtual camera is zooming during battle, approaching the fighters and retreating from them.

It didn't see release outside of Japan except The Pinball Wizard Arcade in Pelham, NH. The game has been described as a beat 'em up inspired by Capcom's Final Fight.[14] It was designed by Junya Inoue, who also designed Toaplan's Knuckle Bash, another beat 'em up inspired by Final Fight.Another Story is unique among the Sailor Moon games as it is an RPG. In battle, compatible Sailor Senshi (2 or 3) can use \"Link Techniques\",[16] which are unique team up attacks with various effects, be they offensive, healing, or defensive. EP (energy points) regenerate after each battle.[17] The storyline of the RPG is fairly linear. All ten members of the Sailor Team are playable. Only five members of the team can be in the player's party at one time. For a good part of the game, the storyline dictates which Senshi are playable, however further into the game the player may choose which Senshi are in the party (though certain Senshi are sill required to be in the party at certain points).With the advice of the ghosts of the Shitennou, the Senshi set out to regain the Barazuishou (Rose Crystal), Tuxedo Mask's stone (which replaces the Golden Crystal in the game) in order to change Sailor Moon's destiny back, and to save Crystal Tokyo.Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon SuperS - Zenin Sanka!!

It was released by Square in North America on October 1, 1995. In February 1996, it saw release in the PAL territories of Europe and Australia. The story of Secret of Evermore follows a boy and his pet dog as they are inadvertently transported to a fantasy world created by an eccentric inventor. The player guides both the boy and his shapeshifting dog through Evermore, a world that is composed of separate realms, each resembling a different period of real-world history. The gameplay shares many similarities with Secret of Mana, such as real-time battles, a ring-shaped menu system, and the ability to switch control between the two characters. Despite similar game mechanics and a similar title, it is not an entry in the Mana Series.[1]Secret of Evermore is unique in that it is the only game developed by Square designers in North America. The game received positive reviews upon its release due to its graphics and gameplay, but was criticized for not being up to the standards of what many reviewers were used to by its developer.Secret of Evermore takes many of its interface and gameplay aspects from Secret of Mana.[2] The game mostly consists of an aerial view setting, in which the boy and his dog negotiate the terrain and fend off hostile creatures. If the boy is currently selected as the player character, his dog will be controlled by the artificial intelligence, and vice-versa. Both characters can find refuge in caves or a town, where they can regain their hit points or purchase restorative items and equipment. Upon collecting enough experience points in battle, either character can increase in level with improved stats such as strength and evasion. Options including changing equipment, casting alchemy spells, or checking status can be quickly performed by rotating through the game's Action Ring system.[3] Combat takes place in real-time. Located below the players hit points is a percentage gauge that determines the amount of damage done to an enemy, as well as how far the player can run. Swinging a weapon or running causes the gauge to fall to 0% and then quickly recharges, allowing the character to attack at full strength or to run at full sprint once it is full. The gauge may also fill up to allowing the player to use charged attacks with equipped weapons.[1][4]In each of the four worlds of Secret of Evermore, the in-game currency will change. The shopkeepers in Prehistoria exchange talons; in Antiqua, gemstones; in Gothica, gold coins; and in Omnitopia, credits.[1] There are individuals in each region who offer to convert the player's money to the local currency. In either of the game's two marketplaces (located in Antiqua and Gothica, respectively), the storekeepers offer to trade in goods instead of money. Certain goods, such as rice, spices, and tapestries, can be bought using the local currency, but others must be exchanged for other goods.[8] Most vendors only specialize in one type of good, and some rare items require an extensive amount of trading to obtain.[1][4]A unique element to Secret of Evermore is its system of magic. In order to cast magic, the boy must be given an \"Alchemic Formula\" by one of many non-playable characters called \"Alchemists\".[1] Some Alchemists make their home in out-of-the-way areas and will dispense rare formulas if the player manages to seek them out. Unlike some role-playing games, there are no magic points needed to cast spells. Alchemy Formulas require pairs of ingredients in order to be used; Some are available throughout the game, and others are only native to certain environments. In the primitive realms, ingredients appear as such items as wax, limestone, clay, and gunpowder.[9] In the advanced realms, however, the ingredients become more complex, such as ethanol and dry ice.[10]The story of Secret of Evermore begins with a black and white flashback to 1965, in a small town called Podunk, USA. In a laboratory situated on the roof of a mansion, a malfunction occurs which floods the area with white flash of light. Thirty years later, the game's young protagonist is leaving a theater when his pet dog chases after a cat in the street. The boy hurriedly follows after him, eventually reaching a large, abandoned mansion. He discovers the hidden laboratory with a large machine built in the center. When the dog begins to chew on some wires, the pair find themselves transported to the surreal world of Evermore, beginning in the space station Omnitopia. A butler dressed in a white tuxedo greets the boy when he appears, only to lock him in a room with several attack robots. The boy manages to escape in a shuttle pod, where he finds his dog holed up in the cockpit.[6]Development on Secret of Evermore began in early 1994 at Square Soft, the Redmond, Washington office of the Japanese parent company Square.[25] The concept of a boy traveling with his dog through a world based on cheesy B movies was dictated from overseas, whereupon Square Soft began work on the detailed storyline.[26] This resulted in popular culture references and dialog that are distinctly American for a mainstream console RPG. The game's associate producer and writer, George Sinfield, decided that making such references would be familiar to American players.[27]Many of Secret of Evermore's elements were copied from Secret of Mana because they had been proven to be effective.[26] The size of the game was an early issue. It was decided that the game would be single-player to preserve memory because it was originally planned to be only 12-megabits.[27] However, the game would double to 24-megabits near the end of development. Various pieces of concept art were designed by Daniel Dociu. Using computer software, including SGI Indy II and Alias workstations, the game's artwork and design were mapped out by three animators, four background artists, and a 3D rendering artist.[27] It was put together using the company's SAGE (Square's Amazing Graphical Editor) program, led by programmer Brian Fehdrau. Rather than having to hand off their work to the programmers, the artists and designers were able to test their ideas directly using the SAGE program.[26] Using another company program, SIGIL (Square Interpreted Game Intelligence Language), Secret of Evermore was made into a final product.[26][27]There is a persistent misconception that the game is, or was released in lieu of, a follow-up to Secret of Mana.[26] Other Square titles such as Final Fantasy VI and Chrono Trigger were being localized simultaneously with the production of Secret of Evermore. Fehdrau explained in an interview that Secret of Evermore was not created in place of Seiken Densetsu 3 and that the team that developed Secret of Evermore was assembled from newly hired staff, and would otherwise never have been assembled.[26] Several of the team members joined Humongous Entertainment,[28] which spawned Cavedog Entertainment, while the rest of the team spread to other Seattle-area game studios like Electronic Arts, Boss Game Studios, Microsoft Game Studios, and Gas Powered Games, among others.Secret of Evermore was released on October 1, 1995, in North America. In 1996, it was translated into German, French and Spanish for the non-English-speaking market in some PAL territories, including Australia and New Zealand.[29] Some PAL versions were packaged in a large box and included a strategy guide.[30]The score for Secret of Evermore was composed by Jeremy Soule as his first video game project. While still in high school Soule was a large fan of video games and he felt that the scores in most games \"lacked drama and intensity.\" After completing high school, Soule created an experimental demo showcasing what he felt video game scores should sound like.[31] Soule was hired by Square Soft after reviewing the demo and was promptly given the task to score Secret of Evermore. The score is described by Soule as a mix of ambient sounds and low-key music.[32] The soundtrack was released on a CD containing 29 tracks, the first eight of which are arranged versions of the original sound. The disc was published by Square and was only initially available to those who pre-ordered Secret of Evermore.[33]Secret of Evermore received positive reviews from most media outlets. Most publications praised its graphics. For instance, RPGFan called the game a \"wonderful visual experience,\" applauding its use of color, animation, and background.[6] Zachary Lewis of RPGamer noted that the locales found in Secret of Evermore were detailed in a much more realistic way than other games of the genre.[13] GamePro was complimentary of its American art-style, but longed for the Japanese art found in other Square titles.[37] Another highlight for many critics was gameplay, particularly aspects also found in Secret of Mana such as the ring menu.[4][6][35]Reviewers were more critical concerning the game's sound. Although the musical score was appreciated for its overall quality, both RPGFan and RPGamer found that there were too few adequately long tracks, with mediocre ambient sound effects to fill the dead time.[6][13] Critics were mixed on the issue of Secret of Evermore being the first game developed by Square in the United States. Super Play found that the game was not up to the standards held by other Square games.[38] Others noted that Secret of Evermore was a decent first attempt by the American team. GamePro dubbed the game \"worthy of a sequel,\" while Game Players anticipated another game from the same development team.[36][37]","title":"Secret of Evermore","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Secret_of_Evermore.jpg/220px-Secret_of_Evermore.jpg","developer":"Square Soft","genre":"Action role-playing game"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_of_Mana","description":"Secret of Mana, originally released in Japan as Seiken Densetsu 2 (聖剣伝説2?, lit. \"Legend of the Sacred Sword 2\"), is a 1993 action role-playing game developed and published by Square (now Square Enix) for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. It is the sequel to the 1991 game Seiken Densetsu, released in North America as Final Fantasy Adventure and in Europe as Mystic Quest, and it was the first Seiken Densetsu title to be marketed as part of the Mana series rather than the Final Fantasy series. Set in a high fantasy universe, the game follows three heroes as they attempt to prevent an empire from conquering the world with the power of an ancient flying warship.Rather than using a turn-based battle system like contemporary role-playing games, Secret of Mana features real-time battles. The game has a unique Ring Command menu system, which pauses the action and allows the player to make decisions in the middle of battle. An innovative cooperative multiplayer system allows a second or third player to drop in and out of the game at any time. Secret of Mana was directed and designed by Koichi Ishii, programmed primarily by Nasir Gebelli, and produced by veteran Square designer Hiromichi Tanaka.Like many other role-playing games of the 16-bit era, Secret of Mana displays a top-down perspective, in which the player characters navigate the terrain and fight off hostile creatures. The game features three such characters: the hero, the girl, and the sprite, named Randi, Primm, and Popoi outside the initial North American release. The player can choose to control each of the characters at any time; whichever character is currently selected, the other two companions are controlled via artificial intelligence. The game may be played simultaneously by up to three players,[1][2] made possible by the Super Multitap accessory for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) console.[3] The Virtual Console version of the game supports three-player gameplay via additional GameCube controllers or Classic Controllers.[4]Secret of Mana was directed and designed by Koichi Ishii, the creator of the game's Game Boy predecessor, Final Fantasy Adventure. He has stated that he feels Secret of Mana is more \"his game\" than other projects he has worked on, such as the Final Fantasy series.[22] The game was programmed primarily by Nasir Gebelli and produced by veteran Square designer Hiromichi Tanaka. The team hoped to build on the foundation of Final Fantasy Adventure, and they included several modified elements from that game and from other popular Square titles in Secret of Mana. In addition to having better graphics and sound quality than its predecessor, the attack power gauge was changed to be more engaging, and the weapon leveling system replaced Final Fantasy Adventure '​s system of leveling up the speed of the attack gauge.[23] The party system also received an upgrade from the first Mana game: instead of temporary companions who could not be upgraded, party members became permanent protagonists and could be controlled by other players.[23] The multiplayer component was not a part of the original design, but was added when the developers realized that they could easily make all three characters human-controlled.[22]The real-time battle system used in Secret of Mana has been described by its creators as an extension of the battle system used in the first three flagship Final Fantasy titles. The system for experience points and leveling up was taken from Final Fantasy III.[24] According to Tanaka, the game's battle system features mechanics that had first been considered for Final Fantasy IV. Similarly, unused features in Secret of Mana were appropriated by the Chrono Trigger team, which like Final Fantasy IV was in production at the time.[22]Secret of Mana was originally planned to be a launch title for the SNES CD add-on. After the deal between Nintendo and Sony to produce the add-on fell through, and Sony decided to develop the SNES CD into the PlayStation console, Square Enix chose to continue to develop the game for the SNES. The game had to be altered to fit onto a standard game cartridge, which had less storage space than the SNES CD add-on would have allowed.[25] The developers initially resisted continuing the project without the CD add-on, feeling that too much of the game would have to be cut, but they were overruled by company management. As a result of the hardware change, several features had to be cut from the game, and some completed work needed to be redone.[22] Most major of these removals was the option to take multiple routes through the game that led to several possible endings, in contrast to the linear journey in the final product.[23] The plot that remained was different than the original conception, and Tanaka has said that the original story had a much darker tone.[22] Ishii has estimated that up to forty percent of the planned game was dropped to meet the space limitations, and critics have suggested that the hardware change led to technical problems when too much happens at once in the game.[22][26] In 2006, Level magazine claimed that Secret of Mana '​s rocky development was Square's main inspiration to move their games, such as the Final Fantasy series, from Nintendo consoles to Sony consoles in 1996.[22]The English translation for Secret of Mana was completed in only 30 days, mere weeks after the Japanese release,[27] and the North American localization was initially advertised as Final Fantasy Adventure 2.[28] Critics have suggested that the translation was done hastily so that the game could be released in North America for the 1993 holiday season.[25] According to translator Ted Woolsey, a large portion of the game's script was cut out in the English localization due to space limitations.[29] To display text on the main gameplay screen, the English translation uses a fixed-width font, which limits the amount of space available to display text. Woolsey was unhappy that he had to trim conversations to their bare essentials and that he had so little time for translation, commenting that it \"nearly killed me\".[30] The script was difficult to translate as it was presented to Woolsey in disordered groups of text, like \"shuffling a novel\".[29] Other localizations were done in German and French. The Japanese release only named the three protagonists in the manual,[31] while Western versions omitted the characters' names until the enhanced port on the iOS.[32][33]The score for Secret of Mana was composed by Hiroki Kikuta. Kenji Ito, who had composed the soundtrack for Final Fantasy Adventure, was originally slated for the project. He was replaced with Kikuta when Ito was forced to drop Secret of Mana due to other demands on his time, such as the soundtrack to Romancing SaGa. It was Kikuta's first video game score.[34] Despite difficulties in dealing with the hardware limitations of the SNES, Kikuta tried to express in the music two \"contrasting styles\" to create an original score which would be neither pop music nor standard game music.[35] Kikuta worked on the music mostly by himself, spending nearly 24 hours a day in his office, alternating between composing and editing to create a soundtrack that would be, according to him, \"immersive\" and \"three-dimensional\".[36] Rather than using pre-made MIDI samples of instruments like most game music composers of the time, Kikuta made his own MIDI samples that matched the hardware capabilities of the SNES. These custom samples allowed him to know exactly how each piece would sound on the system's hardware, so he did not have to worry about differences between the original MIDI sampler and the SNES.[37] Kikuta said in 2001 that he considered the score for Secret of Mana his favorite creation.[38]The 1993 soundtrack album Secret of Mana Original Soundtrack, first released as Seiken Densetsu 2 Original Sound Version in Japan, collects 44 tracks of music from Secret of Mana. Aside from its packaging and localized song titles, the English release is identical to the Japanese original. Secret of Mana was one of the first Japanese games to inspire a localized soundtrack release in North America.[39] An album of arranged music from Secret of Mana and its sequel Seiken Densetsu 3 was produced in 1993 as Secret of Mana+. The music in the album was all composed and arranged by Kikuta. Secret of Mana+ contains a single track, titled \"Secret of Mana\", that incorporates themes from the music of both Secret of Mana and Seiken Densetsu 3, which was still under development at the time.[42] The style of the album has been described by critics as \"experimental\", using \"strange sounds\" such as waterfalls, bird calls, cell phone sounds, and \"typing\" sounds.[43] The music has also been described by critics as covering many different musical styles, such as \"Debussian impressionist styles, his own heavy electronic and synth ideas, and even ideas of popular musicians\".[42] The latest album of music from the game is a 2012 arranged album titled Secret of Mana Genesis / Seiken Densetsu 2 Arrange Album. The 16 tracks are upgraded versions of the original SNES tracks, and Kikuta said in the liner notes for the album that they are \"how he wanted the music to sound when he wrote it\", without the limitations of the SNES hardware. Critics such as Patrick Gann of RPGFan, however, have noted that the differences are minor.[44]In 1999 Square announced they would be porting Secret of Mana to Bandai's handheld system WonderSwan Color as one of nine planned games for the system.[45] No such port was ever released. A mobile phone port of Secret of Mana was released on October 26, 2009.[46] A port of the game for iOS was revealed at E3 2010, and released on Apple's App Store on December 21, 2010.[47] The port fixed several bugs, and the English script was both edited and retranslated from the original Japanese.[48] It was re-released on Wii U's Virtual Console in Japan on June 26, 2013.As of February 2004, Secret of Mana had shipped 1.83 million copies worldwide, with 1.5 million of those copies being shipped in Japan and 330,000 abroad.[58] The initial shipment of games in Japan sold out within days of the release date.[59] Edge noted in November 1993 that the game was \"the most widely covered game of the year in Japan\", with a high number of sales, but was released in North America \"completely un-hyped and mostly unheard of\".[51]Secret of Mana was awarded Game of the Month in December 1993 and Best Role-Playing Game of 1993 by Electronic Gaming Monthly.[52][60] The magazine's reviewers heavily praised the graphics, music, and multiplayer gameplay, saying that it had \"some of the best music I've ever heard from a cartridge\". They hoped that other companies would take the game's lead in adding multiplayer modes to role-playing games.[52] Diehard GameFan '​s review of the game named the multiplayer as the game's best component, with reviewer Kelly Rickards saying that while the graphics were nice, the multiplayer \"made the game\".[61] GamePro '​s review, however, praised the graphics and plot, while stating that the gameplay and multiplayer were \"rough around the edges\".[62]A reviewer for Edge magazine said that Secret of Mana was better than contemporary role-playing games Ys I & II, The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past, and Landstalker: The Treasures of King Nole. The reviewer stated that Secret of Mana \"includes some of the best game design and features ever seen: simultaneous threeplayer action, the best combat system ever designed, the best player interface ever designed, a superb control system, and yes, some of the most engrossing and rewarding gameplay yet\". They concluded that the game was one of the best action RPGs or adventure games.[51] Game designer Sandy Petersen reviewed the game in Dragon, and described the game as much like Zelda but with conventional role-playing game features. He predicted that the game would be regarded as a classic. Peterson concluded that Secret of Mana was one of the best SNES role-playing games and that it was \"a much larger game than Zelda, with many more types of monsters, character options, and fortresses to explore\".[50]In 2008, Lucas Thomas of IGN reviewed the Virtual Console port of Secret of Mana and stated that it was considered one of the best video games ever made.[54] Eurogamer's Dan Whitehead also recommended the port, describing it as \"essential\" and as the formative game of the Mana series.[53] The iOS port of the game was praised by Nadia Oxford of Slide to Play for its improved graphics and computer-controlled characters. She also praised the quality of the touch controls relative to other role-playing game phone versions, though she disliked that the multiplayer mode had been removed.[48]In 2014, Edge magazine described Secret of Mana as \"one of the high points of the 16bit era\". A writer for the magazine noted that, 20 years after Secret of Mana '​s release, its reputation as a SNES action RPG had been surpassed only by that of The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past.[26] Review aggregator site GameRankings lists the game as the 13th-highest rated SNES game.[55] In 1996, Super Play ranked Secret of Mana eighth on its list of the best 100 SNES games of all time.[63] It took 42nd place on Nintendo Power magazine's 2006 \"Top 200 Nintendo Games of All Time\" list, and the magazine called it the 86th best game on a Nintendo system.[64] IGN's \"Top 100 Games\" list ranked the game at number 48 in 2005,[65] number 49 in 2006,[66] and number 79 in 2007.[67] Secret of Mana was an influential game in its time, and its influence continued into the 2010s. Elements such as its ring menu system, described by Edge as \"oft-mimicked\", were borrowed by later games such as The Temple of Elemental Evil.[26][68] Its cooperative multiplayer gameplay has been mentioned as an influence on Dungeon Siege III.[69] The Rabite enemy introduced in Secret of Mana became a mascot character for the Mana series.[26]","title":"Secret of Mana","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b7/Secret_of_Mana_Box.jpg/256px-Secret_of_Mana_Box.jpg","developer":"Square","genre":"Action role-playing"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_of_the_Stars","description":"Secret of the Stars, known as Aqutallion (アクタリオン?) in Japan, is role-playing video game released in 1993 and developed and published by Tecmo for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System.Secret of the Stars use a turn-based RPG battle system where actions in battle are selected through a menu and actions are presented at the end of the turn.

Developed by Sensible Software and first released for Amiga and Atari ST computers in 1992 as well as for the PC, it featured a zoomed-out bird's-eye view (most games until then such as Kick Off and Matchday used a closer top-down or side view), editable national, club and custom teams and gameplay utilising a relatively simple and user-friendly control scheme. One of the defining gameplay elements was the aftertouch feature, which enabled effective but unrealistic swerves.[1] The game topped charts such as Amiga Power's \"All Time Top 100\". The graphic style of the game was used in other Sensible Software games, such as Mega Lo Mania, Cannon Fodder and Sensible Golf.Sensible World of Soccer, commonly referred to as SWOS, was released in 1994. The game was almost published by Virgin Games, but they insisted on it being called Virgin Soccer.[2] It became a first in video games when it attempted to encompass the entire professional footballing world into one game. Featuring many divisions in many countries around the globe, it featured a twenty season career mode which allowed players to manage and play as thousands of different clubs from across the globe, many of which were very obscure.On November 1, 2005, it was announced in an interview at gaming website Eurogamer that the series would make a return in the Summer of 2006, with a full 3D title to be released on PC, PlayStation 2 and Xbox.[3] Codemasters, the holders of the licence, would release the game across all PAL territories, with the design capabilities overseen by Jon Hare, the original designer of the game. On June 9, 2006, it was released in Europe. No North American release is planned at this time.On September 27, 2006, Codemasters announced a new version of Sensible World of Soccer, developed by Kuju Sheffield, for the Xbox 360 to be released in summer 2007 on Xbox Live Arcade. It features both the classic \"retro\" visuals of the original SWOS, as well as new improved high definition graphics, and retains the exact gameplay of the 96/97 version of Sensible World of Soccer.[4] Due to problems with the game's network performance, the release was delayed in order for \"significant proportions\" of the network code to be rewritten.[5] After missing several previous release dates, the game appeared on Xbox Live Arcade on December 19, 2007[6] but was quickly pulled. A statement from Microsoft confirmed that an incorrect version of the game had been made available, in which online play was not possible.[7] The fixed version of the game was released two days later on December 21. The Windows version is still yet to be given a release date.From the time of its release, Mega placed the game at #1 in their Top 50 Mega Drive Games of All Time.[8] The Mega CD version of the game was #2 in their Top 10 Mega CD Games of All Time in the same issue. Sensible World of Soccer 1995/96 received review scores of 96% from both Amiga Power and Amiga Format, the joint highest mark given for any game by either magazine.[9][10]On March 12, 2007, The New York Times reported that The Sensible World of Soccer (1994) was named to a list of the ten most important video games of all time by Stanford Professor Henry Lowood and the four members of his committee – the game designers Warren Spector and Steve Meretzky; Matteo Bittanti, an academic researcher; and Christopher Grant, a game journalist.[11] This list was also announced at the 2007 Game Developers Conference.Sensible World of Soccer (1994) received recognition as one of the Ten Most Important Video Games of All Time, the so-called game canon, by the History of Science and Technology Collections at Stanford University.[12]Atari Jaguar version by Glenn Williams for Renegade Software","title":"","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/73/Sensible_Soccer_cover.png/250px-Sensible_Soccer_cover.png","developer":"","genre":""},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shadow_(video_game)","description":"The Shadow is a 1994 video game published by Ocean.

The video game was developed by Australian company Beam Software and first released in 1993 by Data East.The game is loosely based on the novel Never Deal with a Dragon by Shadowrun co-creator Robert N. Charrette and set in the year 2050. The player takes on the role of Jake Armitage, a man suffering from amnesia after having been critically wounded by assassins. The plot then follows Jake as he attempts to uncover his own identity and the identity of the mysterious figure who wants him dead, and eventually complete his mission. Harebrained Schemes' 2013 Shadowrun Returns links the stories of this game and of Shadowrun for the Sega Genesis.A project to adapt Shadowrun for the SNES had a turbulent history between 1989 and 1993, including having been halted in mid-development before being resumed in late 1992 under a tight deadline. Its eventual lead designer was Paul Kidd, creator of Beam Software's 1991 Nightshade, elements and a feel of which he then carried on to Shadowrun. The game was a critical success, winning a number of industry awards, but was a commercial failure nevertheless. It was retrospectively acclaimed by several publications as an \"ahead of its time\" milestone in the history of the role-playing genre for the consoles and credited for having pioneered film noir style in video games.Shadowrun is an action role-playing game (RPG) that combines the statistical factor of the original tabletop game with real-time gameplay. The player is given direct control over the protagonist Jake and moves him around using the directional pad within the game's isometrically displayed world. A cursor system allows the player to scroll a pointer across the screen and perform various actions that include opening doors and passageways, examining and picking up objects, engaging in conversation with non-player characters (NPCs), and utilizing firearms and magic commands while in combat.In interacting with other characters, Shadowrun allows the player to gain information using a bank of terms. Whenever Jake hears a new and unusual term, this word is highlighted and is then added to the bank that he can use; from that point on, when speaking with NPCs, Jake is able to ask them about this new word; only in this manner can a player progress with the game. As the title of the game implies, Jake is described as a \"shadowrunner,\" a mercenary type of character common within the Shadowrun world. The player is given the option to hire other shadowrunners as henchmen with \"nuyen\", the game's currency that can also be used to purchase guns and certain key items scattered throughout various locations.Combat within Shadowrun often require sharp reflexes, as practically every screen contains hidden assassins who, from random locations, open fire on Jake; the player may retreat or must otherwise immediately find the source of the attack and respond. Enemies typically drop nuyen, while at the same time, Jake builds up \"karma\". If the player retires to a bed to restore health and save one's progress, karma can be allocated into different attributes, skills, and magical powers.At certain points in the game, Shadowrun allows the player to enter cyberspace. Using an item called a \"cyberdeck\", Jake is able to hack into computers to retrieve information, as well as gain more nuyen. During such scenes, the gameplay switches to a top-down perspective while an icon of Jake moves through cyberspace, fights intrusion programs, and retrieves data. If Jake dies in cyberspace, he dies in the outside world as well.Shadowrun is an adaptation of the FASA tabletop role-playing game of the same name. The storyline of the video game is loosely based on the first Shadowrun novel, Never Deal with a Dragon, written by Robert N. Charrette.[4] The narrative opens in Seattle, Washington in the year 2050, where the protagonist Jake Armitage is shown being gunned down in the street. A shapeshifting lupine figure rushes to his side and is seen casting a spell over Jake before leaving hastily as the medics arrive on the scene. Jake awakens in a morgue with a complete memory loss. Soon, he is approached by the \"Dog\", a shamanistic totem who gives him a warning before vanishing.The work to develop an adaptation of Shadowrun for the SNES by the Australian developer Beam Software began when Adam Lanceman, part of the company's management team, acquired the license for FASA's 1989 tabletop RPG.[5] The project was initially headed by Gregg Barnett until he abruptly left Beam midway through the game's development to start Perfect Entertainment in the United Kingdom.[4] The game's production was halted by Beam, but eventually resumed before its set deadline.[5]Having been hired by Beam's parent company Melbourne House, fantasy and sci-fi writer Paul Kidd quickly took Barnett's place as lead designer.[4][5] According to Kidd, the given timeframe for finishing Shadowrun for publisher Data East was very short, forcing the team to complete production in a tumultuous five and a half to six months.[4][6] An avid role-player, Kidd was already familiar with the Shadowrun license, but had to utilize the storyline that his predecessor had already gotten approved.[5] Aspects of Beam's earlier action-adventure game Nightshade, of which Kidd was the writer, director and lead designer, were used as a basis for Shadowrun; specific film noir components such as \"dark cityscapes, dialogue-heavy exchanges, and touches of humor\" were adapted directly from the former to the latter.[6] To coincide with the last of these qualities, Kidd and programmer Jeff Kamenek altered the original \"serious\" tone of Shadowrun by replacing portions of the script and artwork with more comedic elements. According to Kidd, \"we made improvements and changes, but the basic concepts were pretty much the same [as in Nightshade].\"[6]The ROM image of the first version of Shadowrun contains a much more crude script, with more sexual suggestive and violent phrases. For example, one line is changed from \"morgue guys\" to \"chop shop guys.\"[7][8] The game's distributor favored the less serious version for retail release, sparking indignation and conflict among Kidd and other members of Beam's staff.[4][5][6] Kidd recalled: \"Beam Software was a madhouse, a cesspit of bad karma and evil vibes. The war was reaching shooting level; old school creators who just wanted to make good games were being crushed down by a wave of managerial bull. It was no longer a 'creative partnership' in any way; it was 'us' and 'them'. People were feeling creatively and emotionally divorced from their projects.\"[4] Shadowrun was ultimately completed by its deadline. Kidd credits this to the staffers abstaining from company meetings and workshops, and continually keeping management away from the designers.[4]Shadowrun was released in North America and Japan by Data East. In PAL regions, it was self-published by Beam Software as Laser Beam Entertainment. The 1994 Japanese version has a significantly longer introduction sequence than the English version of the game and also has a vertically uncompressed Shadowrun logo on the title screen. Other than that, it uses the same script as the North American and PAL editions, just with Japanese subtitles.[7]The game was met with a positive critical reception and good reviews.[4][5][6] Shadowrun was given a number of awards from various publications, including the title of the Best RPG of the Year by VideoGames, Electronic Games and Game Informer, and was a runner-up for it in GamePro.[4] The game was given the second place Nintendo Power Award in the category \"Most Innovative (Super NES)\" (it was also nominated in the category \"For Challenge\"[13]), Nintendo Power describing it as \"one of the best sci-fi games ever\".[14] However, the game sold poorly, partly because of low shipping numbers.[5]Shadowrun has been positively recounted in many restrospective lists and articles. It was listed it as the 34th best SNES game by Super Play in 1996,[15] as well as the 48th best game on any Nintendo platform by Nintendo Power in 1997.[16] Ranking it as the 77th top SNES game in 2011, IGN commented that while Shadowrun \"didn't quite get away from all the common RPG stereotypes\" it was still \"a milestone for the introduction of film noir style into the gaming industry, though, so we can forgive the game for only being 90% groundbreaking.\"[17] The game was also cited as an important milestone in the use of film noir style in video games by Game Informer, according to which \"Shadowrun '​s moody music and dark streets set the somber tone for this RPG's prying conversations and self-reflective narrative.\"[18] Game Informer also ranked Shadowrun as 125th place on their list of best video games of all time in 2009.[19] IGN Australia listed Shadowrun among their favourite Australian video games in 2010, writing it was \"without question, one of the best underexposed classics of the SNES era\" because it presented players with \"a mature narrative, strong characters and a dystopian backdrop\" blended with traditional RPG elements in an \"irresistible\" way.[20] That same year, 1UP.com included Shadowrun on their list of 15 games \"ahead of their time\" for its use of a keyword dialogue system, common to PC games but foreign to console games of the time.[21]In 2002, GameSpot included it on the list of video games that should be remade and compared this \"groundbreaking RPG\" that was \"truly ahead of its time\" to more recent Planescape: Torment.[22] A remake of the game was also requested by Sam Bandah of X360, who called it a \"rather excellent\", \"little-known classic\" and \"a cyberpunk RPG classic begging to return\", and stated: \"Shadowrun would be a perfect game to remake as a Mass Effect-style RPG – perhaps with the conversation system of the sadly much-maligned Alpha Protocol.\"[23] In 2012, GamesRadar ranked this \"one incredibly unique, noir-style story\" as the third top \"cult-classic franchise\" that should be rebooted similar to how X-COM was.[24]Two co-licensed role-playing video games of the same name were released around the same time by different developers and publishers: the 1994 North America-exclusive Sega Genesis title by BlueSky Software and Sega, and the 1995 Japan-exclusive Sega Mega-CD title by Group SNE and Compile.[25] The storyline and gameplay of the SNES Shadowrun are completely different from these two games. In 2007, FASA Studio and Microsoft Studios released a multiplayer first-person shooter adaptation of the franchise for the Xbox 360 and Microsoft Windows.[26]In 2012, Harebrained Schemes announced that it would be producing a new Shadowrun role-playing video game, Shadowrun Returns, to be funded through Kickstarter. As a result of the Kickstarter appeal reaching a 1.5 million dollar target, Shadowrun '​s original creator and FASA Corporation's founder Jordan Weisman announced that the game would now feature an additional storyline tying in the new game with both the SNES game and the Sega Genesis game. This extra content was initially made available only to backers, becoming generally available some time after release.[27] The protagonist of the SNES game, Jake Armitage, is featured in Shadowrun Returns as both part of the game's main plotline and as an NPC that the player can hire to accompany them on various missions.[28]","title":"Shadowrun","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a2/Shadowrun_SNES_cover.png/235px-Shadowrun_SNES_cover.png","developer":"Beam Software","genre":"Action role-playing"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai_II:_Dragon%27s_Eye","description":"Shanghai is a computer game developed by Activision in 1986 for the Amiga, Macintosh and Apple IIGS and also the Sega Master System.Shanghai is a computerized version of mahjong solitaire.

It was ported to the Amiga, Game Gear and Game Boy platforms in 1995. The game was published by Electronic Arts and developed by the now-defunct Delphine Software International. It features former professional basketball player Shaquille O'Neal (also known as Shaq) as a playable character. Though it met with a mixed response from critics, it has since come to be considered one of the worst video games of all time. A sequel, Shaq-Fu: A Legend Reborn, is in development.[1]The Sega Mega Drive/Genesis version of Shaq Fu has five more playable characters (Auroch, Colonel, Diesel, Leotsu and Nezu) and three more stages (The Lab, The Wasteland, and Yasko Mines) than the Super NES version, therefore the Mega Drive/Genesis version has a longer story mode. The North/South Gate stage is accessible in the SNES version with a cheat code, whereas the Mega Drive/Genesis version has the North/South Gate stage available from the start. The Amiga version is the same as the Mega Drive/Genesis version (it even keeps a \"Licensed by Sega Enterprises, LTD\" leftover from that version in the title screen), but the backgrounds have no animation. It also only has three songs; there is no music during the fights.Shaq Fu received mixed reviews at the time of its release. GamePro gave the SNES version a generally positive review, saying that the unusually small size of the sprites is balanced off by the incredibly fast game speed. They also praised the \"ultra sharp\" controls and impressive digitized graphics.[2] Next Generation Magazine gave a 2/5.[citation needed] One of the multiple reviewers at Electronic Gaming Monthly scored it as a 6/10, and another gave it a 4/10.[3] It received a grade of D from Entertainment Weekly.[4]Retrospective criticism has been generally negative. GameTrailers rated it number 4 Worst in their \"Top Ten Best and Worst Video Games\".[5] Allgame gave it a negative review, commenting that \"Shaq Fu is a dud\" in terms of fighting games based on basketball players.[6] GameInformer magazine placed it number 2 on the Top 10 Fighting Games We'd Like To Forget.[citation needed] In response to the negative feedback to the game, Levi Buchanan from IGN stated it was undeserved as a result of collective exaggerations.[7] The website Shaqfu.com is dedicated to liberating the game from existence by finding and destroying any copies of the game.[8]At the 2014 Consumer Electronics Show, Shaquille O’Neal confirmed speculations in an interview with GamerFitnation that there would be a Shaq Fu 2.[9] On March 6, 2014 an Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign was started for Shaq-Fu: A Legend Reborn. It will feature gameplay that heavily differs from its predecessor. The funding goal was $450,000 USD. If achieved, the game creators at Big Deez Productions promised the game would be released on consoles (PS4, Wii U, PS3, XBox One and XBox 360). The campaign ended on May 5, 2014, with the funding goal exceeded at $473,884.[1] Additionally, the game creators at Big Deez have made an unprecedented announcement: They will be accepting Quark crypto-currency as a method of in-game payment.[10]","title":"Shaq Fu","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e9/ShaqFu_logo.png/256px-ShaqFu_logo.png","developer":"Delphine Software International","genre":"Fighting"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shien%27s_Revenge","description":"","title":"Shien's Revenge","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/69/Shien.jpg/220px-Shien.jpg","developer":"Almanic","genre":"Rail shooter"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_Pocket","description":"Side Pocket (Japanese: サイドポケット, Hepburn: Saido Poketto?) is a pocket billiards video game originally released into arcades by Data East in 1986.

SimCity was Maxis's second product, which has since been ported into various personal computers and game consoles, and spawned several sequels including SimCity 2000 in 1993, SimCity 3000 in 1999, SimCity 4 in 2003, SimCity DS, SimCity Societies in 2007, and SimCity in 2013. Until the release of The Sims in 2000, the SimCity series was the best-selling line of computer games made by Maxis. SimCity spawned a series of Sim games.On January 10, 2008 the SimCity source code was released under the free software GPL 3 license under the original working title- Micropolis.SimCity was originally developed by game designer Will Wright. The inspiration for SimCity came from a feature of the game Raid on Bungeling Bay that allowed Wright to create his own maps during development. Wright soon found he enjoyed creating maps more than playing the actual game, and SimCity was born.[3] While developing SimCity, Wright cultivated a real love of the intricacies and theories of urban planning[4] and acknowledges the influence of System Dynamics which was developed by Jay Wright Forrester and whose book on the subject[5] laid the foundations for the simulation.[6] In addition, Wright also was inspired by reading \"The Seventh Sally\", a short story by Stanisław Lem, in which an engineer encounters a deposed tyrant, and creates a miniature city with artificial citizens for the tyrant to oppress.[7] The game reflected Wright's approval of mass transit and disapproval of nuclear power; Maxis president Jeff Braun stated \"We're pushing political agendas\".[8]The first version of the game was developed for the Commodore 64 in 1985; it was not published for another four years.[9] The original working title of SimCity was Micropolis.[10] The game represented an unusual paradigm in computer gaming, in that it could neither be won nor lost; as a result, game publishers did not believe it was possible to market and sell such a game successfully. Brøderbund declined to publish the title when Wright proposed it, and he pitched it to a range of major game publishers without success. Finally, founder Braun of tiny Maxis agreed to publish SimCity as one of two initial games for the company.[3]Wright and Braun returned to Brøderbund to formally clear the rights to the game in 1988, when SimCity was near completion. After Brøderbund executives Gary Carlston and Don Daglow saw SimCity, they signed Maxis to a distribution deal for both of its initial games. With that, four years after initial development, SimCity was released for the Amiga and Macintosh platforms, followed by the IBM PC and Commodore 64 later in 1989.[9]The objective of SimCity, as the name of the game suggests, is to build and design a city, without specific goals to achieve (except in the scenarios, see below). The player can mark land as being zoned as commercial, industrial, or residential, add buildings, change the tax rate, build a power grid, build transportation systems and take many other actions, in order to enhance the city. Once able to construct buildings in a particular area, the too-small-to-see residents, known as Sims,[11] may choose to construct and upgrade houses, apartment blocks, light or heavy industrial buildings, commercial buildings, hospitals, churches, and other structures. The Sims make these choices based on such factors as traffic levels, adequate electrical power, crime levels, and proximity to other types of buildings—for example, residential areas next to a power plant will seldom appreciate to the highest grade of housing.[12]The original SimCity kicked off a tradition of goal-centered, timed scenarios that could be won or lost depending on the performance of the player/mayor. The scenarios were an addition suggested by Brøderbund in order to make SimCity more like a game.[13] The original cities were all based on real world cities and attempted to re-create their general layout, a tradition carried on in SimCity 2000 and in special scenario packs. While most scenarios either take place in a fictional timeline or have a city under siege by a fictional disaster, a handful of available scenarios are based on actual historical events.In addition, the later edition of SimCity on the Super NES included the basics of these two scenarios in two, more difficult scenarios that were made available after a player had completed the original scenarios:SimCity was originally released for home computers, including the Amiga, Atari ST and DOS-based IBM PC. After its success it was converted for several other computer platforms and video game consoles, specifically the Commodore 64, Macintosh, Acorn Archimedes, Amstrad CPC, Sinclair ZX Spectrum, BBC Micro, Acorn Electron, Super Nintendo Entertainment System (which was later released on Virtual Console), EPOC32, mobile phone, Internet, Windows, FM-Towns, OLPC XO-1 and NeWS HyperLook on Sun Unix. The game is also available as a multiplayer version for X11 TCL/Tk on various Unix, Linux, DESQview and OS/2 operating systems. In addition, a version was developed in 1991 for the Nintendo Entertainment System, and another Japanese version was initiated in 1992 for the MSX computers, but these two were never released. Certain versions have since been re-released with various add-ons, including extra scenarios. An additional extra add on for the Windows version of SimCity Classic was a level editor. This editor could be opened without use of the SimCity Classic disc. The level editor is a simple tool that allows the user to create grasslands, dirt land, and water portions.The IBM version of SimCity is notable for the unusually large amount of graphics modes it supports; the game can run in CGA, Tandy, EGA low-resolution, EGA high resolution, EGA monochrome, and VGA monochrome. A later release dropped CGA, Tandy, and EGA low-resolution support and replaced them with color VGA modes.In 2007 the developer Don Hopkins released a free and open source version of the original SimCity, renamed Micropolis (the original working title) for trademark reasons, for the One Laptop per Child XO-1.[14][15] In 2008, Maxis established an online browser-based version of SimCity.[16] A second browser-based version was later released under the name \"Micropolis\".[17] In 2013, another browser-based version—this time ported using Javascript and HTML5—was released as \"micropolisJS\".[18]SimCity for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System features the same gameplay and scenario features; however, since it was developed and published by Nintendo, the company incorporated their own ideas. Instead of the Godzilla monster disaster, Bowser of the Super Mario series becomes the attacking monster, and once the city reaches a landmark 500,000 populace, the player receives a Mario statue that is placeable in the city. The Nintendo port also features special buildings the player may receive as rewards, similar to the rewards buildings in SimCity 2000. The game also includes schools and hospitals, though they cannot be placed by the player. Instead, the game will sometimes turn an empty residential lot into one. There are also city classifications, such as becoming a metropolis at 100,000 people. Also unique to the SNES version is a character named \"Dr. Wright\" (whose physical appearance is based on Will Wright) who acts as an adviser to the player. The soundtrack to the Nintendo version was composed by Soyo Oka. This edition is featured as Nintendo's Player's Choice as a million seller.In August 1996 a version of the game entitled BS Sim City Machizukuri Taikai was broadcast exclusively to Japanese players via the SNES's Satellaview subsystem. Later, an official Japan-only sequel titled SimCity 64 was released for the Japan-only Nintendo 64 add-on, the Nintendo 64DD.In January 2008, the SimCity source code was released under the free software GPL 3 license.[19] The release of the source code was related to the donation of SimCity software to the One Laptop Per Child program, as one of the principles of the OLPC laptop is the use of free and open source software. The open source version is called Micropolis (the initial name for SimCity) since EA retains the trademark Simcity. The version shipped on OLPC laptops will still be called SimCity, but will have to be tested by EA quality assurance before each release to be able to use that name. The Micropolis source code has been translated to C++, integrated with Python and interfaced with both GTK+ and OpenLaszlo.[20]Micropolis (also called OLPC SimCity) is a release of the city-building sim game SimCity,[21] that was developed by Don Hopkins. It is based on the source code the X11 version of SimCity for the Unix operating system, which was donated to the One Laptop per Child (OLPC) project by Electronic Arts as free and open source software under the terms of the GNU General Public License in 2008.[22]The original version of SimCity was developed by Maxis on the Commodore 64, and ported to various platforms, including the Macintosh. Maxis licensed the Macintosh SimCity source code to DUX software, to port to Unix. DUX Software contracted Don Hopkins to port SimCity to Unix, and he developed SimCity HyperLook Edition, while working at The Turing Institute on HyperLook with Arthur van Hoff. The user interface was written in PostScript, which ran on the NeWS window system on Sun workstations, and it supported multiple zoomable views, pie menus, annotating and printing maps, and many user interface improvements.After Sun canceled NeWS, DUX Software contracted Hopkins to rewrite the HyperLook user interface in TCL/Tk for X11, and he developed a multi-player networked user interface using the X11 protocol. The TCL/Tk version of SimCity has been ported to various Unix and non-Unix platforms, including SunOS, Solaris, IRIX, HP-UX, OSF/1, Quarterdeck Desqview/X, NCD X Terminals, Warp, and Linux. The contract to sell SimCity for Unix expired after ten years, so the TCL/Tk version was no longer commercially available. OLPC SimCity is based on the TCL/Tk version of SimCity, a trademark of Electronic Arts. Don Hopkins adapted it to the OLPC, thanks to the support of John Gilmore. OLPC SimCity will be shipped with the OLPC, and it has been run through EA's quality assurance process and reviewed for integrity. EA reserves the right to review and approve any version of the game distributed under the name SimCity.Micropolis is the name of the current GPL open source code version of OLPC SimCity.Since Micropolis is licensed under the GPL, users can do anything they want with it that conforms with the GPL – the only restriction is that they cannot call it \"SimCity\" (along with a few other limitations to protect EA's trademarks).[23] This allows other, differently named projects to be forked from the Micropolis source code. Improvements to the open source code base that merits EA's approval may be incorporated into the official \"OLPC SimCity\" source code, to be distributed with the OLPC under the trademarked name OLPC SimCity, but only after it has been reviewed and approved by EA.[21]Because of this new functionality, SimCity 2 requires at least 1MB of memory, twice that of the original version.The SNES version of SimCity has been released for the Wii's Virtual Console service (No longer available as of January 2, 2013).SimCity was very successful, selling one million copies by late 1992.[8] It was critically acclaimed and received significant recognition within a year after its initial release. As of December 1990 (from a Maxis document by Sally Vandershaf, Maxis P.R. Coordinator) the game was reported to have won the following awards:In addition, SimCity won the Origins Award for \"Best Military or Strategy Computer Game\" of 1989 in 1990,[citation needed] was named to Computer Gaming World '​s Hall of Fame for games readers highly rated over time,[31] and the multiplayer X11 version of the game was also nominated in 1992 as the Best Product of the Year in Unix World.[citation needed] SimCity was named #4 \"Ten Greatest PC Game Ever\" by PC World in 2009.[32] It was named one of the sixteen most influential games in history at Telespiele, a German technology and games trade show, in 2007.[33] Sid Meier in 2008 named SimCity as one of the three most important innovations in videogame history, as it led to other games that encouraged players to create, not destroy.[34] It was named #11 on IGN's 2009 \"Top 25 PC Games of All Time\" list.[35]The University of Southern California and University of Arizona used SimCity in urban planning and political science classes. In 1990 The Providence Journal invited five candidates for Mayor of Providence, Rhode Island to manage a SimCity town resembling the city; former mayor Buddy Cianci, who was the most successful, won election that year.[8]The SimCity Terrain Editor was reviewed in 1989 in Dragon #147 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in \"The Role of Computers\" column. The reviewers gave the expansion 4 out of 5 stars.[36]On March 12, 2007, The New York Times reported that SimCity was named to a list of the ten most important video games of all time, the so-called game canon.[38] The Library of Congress took up a video game preservation proposal and began with the games from this list, including SimCity.[39][40]The subsequent success of SimCity speaks for itself: \"Sim\" games of many types were developed – with Will Wright and Maxis developing myriad titles including SimEarth, SimFarm, SimTown, Streets of SimCity, SimCopter, SimAnt, SimLife, SimIsle, SimTower, SimPark, SimSafari, and The Sims, as well as the unreleased SimsVille and SimMars. They also obtained licenses for some titles developed in Japan, such as SimTower and Let's Take The A-Train (just called A-Train outside of Japan). In 2000 The Sims was released, which spawned its own series. Spore, released in 2008, was originally going to be titled \"SimEverything\" – a name that Will Wright thought might accurately describe what he was trying to achieve. SimCity yielded several sequels.SimCity inspired a new genre of video games. \"Software toys\" that were open-ended with no set objective were developed trying to duplicate SimCity's success. The most successful was most definitely Wright's own The Sims, which went on to be the best selling computer game of all time. The ideas pioneered in SimCity have been incorporated into real-world applications as well. For example, VisitorVille simulates a city based on website statistics.The series also spawned a SimCity collectible card game, produced by Mayfair Games.","title":"SimCity","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/7b/SimCity_Classic_cover_art.jpg/250px-SimCity_Classic_cover_art.jpg","developer":"Maxis","genre":"City-building game"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SimCity_2000","description":"SimCity 2000 (SC2K) is a city-building simulation video game and the second installment in the SimCity series. SimCity 2000 was first released by Maxis in 1994 for computers running Apple Macintosh Operating System. It was later released on the Amiga, DOS & Microsoft Windows, followed by a release for OS/2.[1] In 1995, SimCity 2000 won \"Best Military or Strategy Computer Game\" Origins Award.The unexpected and enduring success of the original SimCity, combined with the relative lack of success with other \"Sim\" titles, finally motivated the development of a sequel. SimCity 2000 was a major extension of the concept; the view was now dimetric instead of overhead, land could have different elevations, and underground layers were introduced for water pipes and subways.New types of facilities include prisons, schools, libraries, museums, marinas, hospitals and arcologies. Players can build highways, roads, bus depots, railway tracks, subways, train depots and zone land for seaports and airports. There are a total of nine varieties of power plants in SimCity 2000, including coal, oil, natural gas, nuclear, wind turbines, hydroelectric dams (which can only be placed on waterfall tiles), solar and the futuristic fusion power and satellite microwave plant. Most types of power plants have a limited life span and must be rebuilt periodically. Players can build highways to neighboring cities to increase trade and the population.Another new addition in SimCity 2000 is the query tool. Using the query tool on tiles reveals information such as structure name and type, altitude, and land value. Certain tiles also display additional information; power plants, for example, display the percentage of power being consumed when queried, and querying roads displays the amount of traffic on that tile. Querying a library and selecting \"Ruminate\" displays an essay written by Neil Gaiman.News comes in the form of several pre-written newspaper articles with variable names that could either be called up immediately or could be subscribed to on a yearly basis. The newspaper option provided many humorous stories as well as relevant ones, such as new technology, warnings about aging power plants, recent disasters and opinion polls (highlighting city problems). SimCity 2000 is the only game in the entire series to have this feature (besides the discontinued children's version, SimTown), though newer versions have a news ticker. The newspapers had random titles (Times, Post, Herald, etc.), and prices based on the simulated year. Certain newspapers have a special monthly humor advice column by \"Miss Sim\". Some headlines have no purpose whatsoever in the game, such as \"Bald Radio Found\" or \"Frog Convention\".Though there is no \"true\" victory sequence in SimCity 2000, the \"exodus\" is a close parallel. An \"exodus\" occurs during the year 2051 or later, when 300 or more Launch Arcologies are constructed; the following January each one \"takes off\" into space so that their inhabitants can form new civilizations on distant worlds.[2] This reduces the city's population to those who are not living in the Launch Arcologies, but it also opens wide areas for redevelopment and returns their construction cost to the city treasury. This is related to the event in SimEarth where all cities are moved into rocket-propelled domes that then leave to \"found new worlds\" (leaving no sentient life behind).SimCity 2000 was the first Sim game to feature the semi-nonsensical phrase \"Reticulating Splines\", which means to make a network of splines. Will Wright has stated in an interview that the game does not actually reticulate splines when generating terrain, and he just inserted the phrase because it \"sounded cool\".[citation needed] The phrase has since been featured in SimCopter, SimCity 4, The Sims, The Sims 2, Spore, The Sims 3, The Sims Social and SimCity Social. It is also used in the web-based game Glitch, the popular video game Minecraft (as a title screen splash text), the music service Turntable.fm, the free online education sites khanacademy.org and grovo.com, the operating system Ubuntu, the photo-sharing sites Flickr and SnapJoy, the Humble Indie Bundle Android app, when compiling the Firefox webbrowser, when generating certain reports in SEOmoz, when preparing the game collection analysis in Raptr, and the free-to-play game HAWKEN.In 1994, Maxis released an expansion pack to SimCity 2000 called Scenarios Vol. I: Great Disasters, which included new scenarios based on a number of possible disasters. These disasters generally destroy the city and require the player to rebuild the city. They include: A UFO attack, two nuclear meltdown scenarios, two major chemical spill scenarios, a large flood, a major hurricane, two firestorm scenarios, a volcano, an earthquake, a high power microwave beam misfire, riots, and a typhoon.Alongside the Great Disasters Scenarios package came the introduction of a separate toolset called the SimCity Urban Renewal Kit (SCURK for short). It enabled players to modify the images used in-game to represent various buildings in much the same manner as general image manipulation software. The player was able to create basic bitmap files of a standard size with a standard 256 color palette. The use of limited palette cycling, which permitted animation, was also possible. A number of pre-altered graphics packages were distributed, including some which replaced the reward buildings with images of various well known international buildings, such as the Eiffel Tower, but most buildings were made by fan-artists and shared on the Internet. Several SCURK designs influenced the designs of SimCity 3000 '​s original buildings. The cities made in SCURK can be saved and used for SimCity 2000. SCURK would also pave way to a hobby of creating custom cities for SimCopter and Streets of SimCity.SimCity 2000 has been released on a wide range of platforms and version since its debut in 1994, ranging from ports of personal computers and video game consoles, to special editions.A re-packaged version of SimCity 2000, SimCity 2000 Special Edition (also known as the CD Collection), was released in 1995 for Microsoft Windows and DOS PCs. In addition to containing All expansions, it also featured the SimCity Urban Renewal Kit, the Vol. 1 scenario pack, remade music, new cities selected by Maxis from a 1994 competition, bonus scenarios and cities, and movies.[3]The movies were a first for Maxis; SimCity 2000-SE was the first \"Sim\" game to feature \"real\" videos (compared to \"animated bitmaps\", such as the winning screen in SimAnt). These videos included the introduction movie and four commentary videos by Will Wright; the latter were accessed via the \"WillTV\" application that came with the game.SimCity 2000 Network Edition, sometimes unofficially referred to as the \"Gold Edition\", was released in 1996 for Windows only. The game featured slightly different gameplay in network mode, where mayors may start with more money, but must buy land before building upon it. Players of the Network edition had the ability to share in-game resources and to compete or cooperate with other cities.A Japan-only release of SimCity 2000 for the Nintendo 64 in 1997, produced and published by Imagineer Co., Ltd.Another Japan-only release, SimCity 64 was based on the SimCity 2000 game but was heavily customized for the Nintendo 64DD game system. The ability to view the city at night was added, pedestrian level free-roaming of a city, and individual road vehicles and pedestrians controlled by their own AI wandered the player's city. Cities in the game are also presented in much more advanced 3D graphics, making SimCity 64 the first true 3D SimCity game.This was actually one of the first console ports of SimCity 2000 to any home system. However, there were a lot of losses and differences from the original version of SimCity 2000.The scrolling screen takes much longer than normal to scroll, which was considered to be one of the reasons for the overall rarity of this particular port of the game. However, the in-game controls, while having big icons that would be later used in the PlayStation, Sega Saturn, and Game Boy Advance ports of the game, were actually considered to be far easier to use than the original controls for the PC version of the game. As the previous SimCity title, there was no SNES Mouse support for this game. There were far more errors than the original PC version of the game when it came to the newspapers and their articles. The disasters of riots and volcanoes (as well as possibly a few other disasters) were removed from the game. The game had fewer songs to choose from than the original PC version but they were also considered to be surprisingly superior to the original version of SimCity 2000 on the PC. Finally, each city allows the player to choose a name for the mayor at the beginning instead of being forced to have the same name unless the game was reinstalled as in the PC version. Also, compared to the PC version, the SNES port omits the cheat codes, limits the city maps to six, has no difficulty setting and only includes five generic scenarios. Furthermore, there was only one newspaper for the whole city, no matter what size that the city is, and it will be always labeled as (insert the name of a city here) Newspaper. In addition, unlike the PC version of the game, the stock photographs were replaced with more Japanese anime/manga-like pictures in this port of the game. This is the only port of the game to feature such pictures. All team names, city names, and mayor names were limited to only 8 characters, whereas the PC version allows for up to 32 characters for a city name and a mayor name. There were, however, additional gifts: a bigger city hall at 1,000,000 population, a TV station at 2,000,000 population, and a rocket launching pad at 3,000,000 population. The player can also see an actual launch of a single launch arco when you achieve 5,000,000 population in the last scenario.Released by Zoo Digital in 2003, SimCity 2000 for the Game Boy Advance featured most of the same content as previous versions, but several features are omitted, such as launch arcos. There is no water system, but it is unknown whether this was to make it a better portable experience or because of technical limitations.Several games were released as spinoffs to SimCity 2000.","title":"SimCity 2000","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/d4/SimCity_2000_Coverart.png","developer":"Maxis","genre":"Simulation"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SimEarth","description":"SimEarth: The Living Planet is the second life simulation video game designed by Will Wright, in which the player controls the development of a planet.

The Smurfs (Les Schtroumpfs) are a fictional group of small sky blue creatures who live in a Village in the woods.

An Intellivision version was planned but never developed or released.[citation needed]Gargamel has kidnapped Smurfette. As a Smurf, the player has to walk from the Smurf village through a forest and a cave on the way to Gargamel's castle, where Smurfette awaits rescue. The player has an energy bar that slowly depletes over time. Each side-scrolling screen presents various obstacles that the player must precisely jump over (e.g. fences, stalagmites) or land upon (e.g. ledges). Failure to execute any jump results in instant death. Higher difficulty levels introduce flying bats and spiders that the player must also avoid.The ColecoVision version of Smurf: Rescue in Gargamel's Castle contains an Easter egg (or programming error).

It was unveiled in October 1983, just four months after the Dragon's Lair game, then released in Spring 1984, and like its predecessor featured film-quality animation played back from a laserdisc.Like Dragon's Lair, the gameplay of Space Ace requires the player to move the joystick in the right direction or press the fire button at the right moment to avoid the various hazards Dexter/Ace faces. Space Ace introduced a few gameplay enhancements, most notably selectable skill levels and multiple paths through several of the scenes. At the start of the game the player could select one of three skill levels; \"Cadet\", \"Captain\" or \"Ace\" for easy, medium and hard respectively — only by choosing the toughest skill level could the player see all the sequences in the game (only around half the scenes are played on the easiest setting). A number of the scenes had \"multiple choice\" moments when the player could choose how to act, sometimes by choosing which way to turn in a passageway, or by choosing whether or not to react to the on-screen \"Energize!\" message and transform back into Ace.[1] Most scenes also have separate reverse versions of each other. Dexter usually progresses through scenes by avoiding obstacles and enemies, but Ace goes on the offensive, attacking enemies rather than running away; although Dexter does occasionally have to use his pistol on enemies when it is necessary to advance. An example can be seen in the first scene of the game, when Dexter is escaping from Borf's robot drones. If the player presses the fire button at the right moment, Dexter transforms temporarily into Ace and can fight them, whereas if the player chooses to stay as Dexter the robots' drill attacks must be dodged instead.Space Ace follows the adventures of the musclebound hero Ace. At the start of the game, the villainous Commander Borf attacks Ace with the \"Infanto Ray\", a weapon that transforms him into an adolescent version of himself, and kidnaps his girlfriend Kimberly. It is up to the player to guide Dexter, Ace's younger incarnation, through a series of obstacles in pursuit of Borf, in order to rescue Kimberly and prevent Borf using the Infanto Ray to conquer Earth. The game's attract mode introduces the player to the story via the following narration and dialogue:The animation for Space Ace was produced by the same team that tackled the earlier Dragon's Lair, headed by ex-Disney animator Don Bluth. To keep the production costs down, the studio again chose to use its staff to provide voices for the characters rather than hire actors (one exception is Michael Rye who reprises his role as the narrator of the attract sequence, as he did on Dragon's Lair). Don Bluth himself provides the (electronically altered) voice of Commander Borf. In an interview about the game, Bluth had stated that had the studio been able to afford more professional actors, he thought Paul Shenar would have been more suitable for the role of Borf than himself. The game's animation features some rotoscoping, wherein models were built of Ace's spaceship \"Star Pac\", his motorcycle, and the tunnel in the game's dogfight sequence, then filmed and traced over to render moving animated images with very realistic depth and perspective.Space Ace was made available to distributors in two different formats; a dedicated cabinet, and a conversion kit that could be used to turn an existing copy of Dragon's Lair into a Space Ace game. Early version #1 production units of the dedicated Space game were actually issued in Dragon's Lair style cabinets. The latter version #2 dedicated Space Ace units came in a different, inverted style cabinet. The conversion kit included the Space Ace laserdisc, new EPROMs containing the game program, an additional circuit board to add the skill level buttons, and replacement artwork for the cabinet. The game originally used the Pioneer LD-V1000 or PR-7820 laserdisc players, but an adaptor kit now exists to allow Sony LDP series players to be used as replacements if the original player is no longer functional.Numerous versions of Space Ace were created for home computers and game systems, most of which attempted to mimic the arcade version's lushly animated graphics, with varying degrees of success. A sequel, Space Ace II: Borf's Revenge, was created for the PC mixing new animation with scenes from the original game that were left out of the PC version due to the high amount of memory they comprised.[2] Along with the floppy disk-based versions for Amiga and Atari ST, ReadySoft issued a CD-ROM version featuring downsampled video for the Macintosh which preserved almost all of the original laserdisc content.In 1991, Leland Corporation released a slightly updated version of Space Ace in the form of a conversion kit for the then recently released Dragon's Lair II: Time Warp. The updated version added more complicated moves (including diagonal moves), and dropped the easier skill levels, meaning only the \"Ace\" (difficult) level could be played.In 1993 Space Ace was released for the Philips CD-i (Compact Disc Interactive).Space Ace was also released for the SNES by Absolute Entertainment in 1994. However, since a SNES cartridge has limited storage, it ended up being a side-scroller with levels based on the scenes from the laserdisc. It received negative reviews from fans and critics alike. It was criticized for poor controls and no life bar, meaning that Dexter can take one hit before the player loses a life. Also, to make matters worse, in order to see the credits, the player must get a \"Ace\" rank on every level, meaning that the player must get a nearly perfect accuracy and collect the disks throughout the level. However, as it is nearly impossible due to the fact that the crosshair must be on the enemy prior to the enemy being destroyed, players tend to use emulators to save-state.The Dragon's Lair Deluxe Pack released by Digital Leisure Inc. in 1997 featured Space Ace along with both arcade Dragon's Lair games. They also released a version of Space Ace on DVD that could be played on most DVD players, although it lacked the skill level select of the arcade version, and also played somewhat differently (if the player made a mistake on the arcade version they simply picked up again roughly where they left off, whereas the DVD version forced the player to replay the entire scene from the beginning).In the December 2003 issue of PSW (PlayStation World) a free disk was given away with the magazine featuring Space Ace on one side (accompanied by trailers for similar games), and trailers for upcoming games on the other.Space Ace has most recently appeared on the Nintendo Wii as part of the Dragon's Lair Trilogy, which also features Dragon's Lair, and Dragon's Lair II: Time Warp. It was later released on the DSiWare in North America on December 6, 2010 and in the PAL region on December 31, 2010.A short-lived cartoon series based on Space Ace was produced in 1984 as part of the Saturday Supercade cartoon block (which was composed of cartoon shorts based on current video games) with Space Ace voiced by Jim Piper, Dexter voiced by Sparky Marcus, Kimberly voiced by Nancy Cartwright, and Commander Borf voiced by Arthur Burghardt. Twelve Space Ace episodes were produced.[4] The episodes were once shown on Cartoon Network and are still sometimes shown as filler in Boomerang's Boomeraction block.Samurai Jack references Space Ace and the other Don Bluth-animated arcade game, Dragon's Lair, in an episode where Samurai Jack asks which path to take to reach a dragon's lair, he is told the left; when he asks what the right path leads to, Jack is told, \"Space Ace.\"","title":"Space Ace","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/85/Space_Ace_arcade_flyer.jpg/220px-Space_Ace_arcade_flyer.jpg","developer":"Advanced Microcomputer Systems","genre":"Action Interactive Movie"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Football:_One_on_One","description":"Space Football: One on One, known in Japan as Super Linear Ball (スーパーリニアボール?), is an video game developed by Bits Studios and released in 1992 exclusively for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System.

It was originally manufactured and sold by Taito in Japan, and was later licensed for production in the United States by the Midway division of Bally. Space Invaders is one of the earliest shooting games and the aim is to defeat waves of aliens with a laser cannon to earn as many points as possible. In designing the game, Nishikado drew inspiration from popular media: Breakout, The War of the Worlds, and Star Wars. To complete it, he had to design custom hardware and development tools.It was one of the forerunners of modern video gaming and helped expand the video game industry from a novelty to a global industry (see golden age of video arcade games). When first released, Space Invaders was very successful.The game has been the inspiration for other video games, re-released on numerous platforms, and led to several sequels. The 1980 Atari 2600 version quadrupled the system's sales and became the first \"killer app\" for video game consoles. Space Invaders has been referenced and parodied in multiple television shows, and been a part of several video game and cultural exhibitions. The pixelated enemy alien has become a pop culture icon, often used as a synecdoche representing video games as a whole.Space Invaders is a two-dimensional fixed shooter game in which the player controls a laser cannon by moving it horizontally across the bottom of the screen and firing at descending aliens. The aim is to defeat five rows of eleven aliens—some versions feature different numbers—that move horizontally back and forth across the screen as they advance towards the bottom of the screen. The player defeats an alien, and earns points, by shooting it with the laser cannon. As more aliens are defeated, the aliens' movement and the game's music both speed up. Defeating the aliens brings another wave that is more difficult, a loop which can continue without end.[4][10][11][12]Space Invaders was created by Tomohiro Nishikado, who spent a year designing the game and developing the necessary hardware to produce it.[13] The game's inspiration is reported to have come from varying sources, including an adaptation of the mechanical game Space Monsters released by Taito in 1972, and a dream about Japanese school children who are waiting for Santa Claus and are attacked by invading aliens.[4][14] However, Nishikado has cited Atari's arcade game Breakout as his inspiration. He aimed to create a shooting game that featured the same sense of achievement from completing stages and destroying targets, but with more complex graphics.[13][15] Nishikado used a similar layout to that of Breakout, but altered the game mechanics. Rather than bounce a ball to attack static objects, players are given the ability to fire projectiles at their own discretion to attack moving enemies.[16]Early enemy designs included tanks, combat planes, and battleships.[13] Nishikado, however, was not satisfied with the enemy movements; technical limitations made it difficult to simulate flying.[13][17] Humans would have been easier to simulate, but Nishikado considered shooting them immoral.[17][18] After seeing a magazine feature about Star Wars, he thought of using a space theme.[13][15] Nishikado drew inspiration for the aliens from H. G. Wells' The War of the Worlds—he had watched the 1953 film adaptation as a child—and created initial bitmap images after the octopus-like aliens.[13][15][17] Other alien designs were modeled after squids and crabs.[13][17] The game was originally titled Space Monsters, inspired by a popular song in Japan at the time (\"Monster\"), but was changed to Space Invaders by Nishikado's superiors.[13][15]Because microcomputers in Japan were not powerful enough at the time to perform the complex tasks involved in designing and programming Space Invaders, Nishikado had to design his own custom hardware and development tools for the game.[13][17] He created the arcade board using new microprocessors from the United States.[15] The game uses an Intel 8080 central processing unit, and features raster graphics on a CRT monitor and monaural sound hosted by a combination of analogue circuitry and a Texas Instruments SN76477 sound chip.[18][6][19] Despite the specially developed hardware, Nishikado was unable to program the game as he wanted—the Control Program board was not powerful enough to display the graphics in color or move the enemies faster—and he considered the development of the hardware the most difficult part of the whole process.[13][17] While programming the game, Nishikado discovered that the processor was able to render the alien graphics faster the fewer were on screen. Rather than design the game to compensate for the speed increase, he decided to keep it as a challenging gameplay mechanic.[15][20]Space Invaders was first released in a cocktail-table format with black and white graphics, while the Western release by Midway was in an upright cabinet format. The upright cabinet uses strips of orange and green cellophane over the screen to simulate color graphics. The graphics are reflected onto a painted backdrop of a moon against a starry background.[11] Later Japanese releases used rainbow-colored cellophane,[11] such as T.T. Space Invaders in 1978,[21] followed by a version with a full color display.[11] The cabinet artwork features large, humanoid monsters not present in the game. Nishikado attributes this to the artist basing the designs on the original title, Space Monsters, rather than referring to the in-game graphics.[13]Despite its simplicity, the music to Space Invaders was revolutionary in the gaming industry. Videogame scholar Andrew Schartmann identifies three aspects of the music that would have a significant impact on the development of game music:At the deepest of conceptual levels, one would be hard-pressed to find an arcade game as influential to the early history of videogame music as Space Invaders. Its role as a harbinger of the fundamental techniques that would come to shape the industry remains more or less unchallenged. And its blockbuster success ensured the adoption of those innovations by the industry at large.After the first few months following its release in Japan, the game became very popular.[18] Specialty arcades opened with nothing but Space Invaders cabinets,[13][18] and by the end of 1978, Taito had installed over 100,000 machines and grossed over $600 million in Japan alone.[27] Within two years by 1980,[28] Taito had sold over 300,000 Space Invaders arcade machines in Japan,[29] in addition to 60,000 machines in the United States,[28][30] where prices ranged from $2000 to $3000 for each machine,[31] within one year.[32] The arcade cabinets have since become collector's items with the cocktail and cabaret versions being the rarest.[33] By mid-1981, more than four billion quarters, or $1 billion, had been grossed from Space Invaders machines,[34] and it would continue to gross an average of $600 million a year[35] through to 1982, by which time it had grossed $2 billion in quarters[36][37] (equivalent to $7.23 billion in 2014),[38] with a net profit of $450 million[37] (equivalent to $1.63 billion in 2014).[38] This made it the best-selling video game and highest-grossing entertainment product of its time,[36] with comparisons made to the then highest-grossing film Star Wars,[36][39] which had grossed $486 million[39] in movie tickets (costing $2.25 each on average)[36] with a net profit of $175 million.[39] Space Invaders had earned Taito profits of over $500 million.[13][40] The 1980 Atari 2600 version was the first official licensing of an arcade game and became the first \"killer app\" for video game consoles by quadrupling the system's sales.[11][41] It sold over two million units in its first year on sale as a home console game,[42] making it the first title to sell a million cartridges.[43] Other official ports of the game were made for the Atari 8-bit computer line and Atari 5200 console. Taito released it for the NES in 1985 (Japan only). Numerous unofficial clones were made as well, such as the popular computer games Super Invader (1979)[44] and TI Invaders (1981).An oft-quoted urban legend states that there was a shortage of 100-yen coins—and subsequent production increase—in Japan attributed to the game,[13][45][46] although in actuality, 100-yen coin production was lower in 1978 and 1979 than in previous or subsequent years.[47][48] The claim also doesn't hold up to logical scrutiny; arcade operators would have emptied out their machines and taken the money to the bank, thus keeping the coins in circulation.[48] Reports from those living in Japan at the time indicate \"nothing out of the ordinary ... during the height of the Space Invaders invasion.\"[48]Game designer Shigeru Miyamoto considered Space Invaders a game that revolutionized the video game industry; he was never interested in video games before seeing it.[49] Hideo Kojima also described it as the first video game that impressed him and got him interested in video games.[50] Several publications ascribed the expansion of the video game industry from a novelty into a global industry to the success of the game. Edge magazine attributed the shift of video games from bars and arcades to more mainstream locations like restaurants and department stores to Space Invaders.[51] Its popularity was such that it was the first game where an arcade machine's owner could make up for the cost of the machine in under one month, or in some places within one week.[32]Technology journalist Jason Whittaker credited the game's success to ending the video game crash of 1977, which had earlier been caused by Pong clones flooding the market, and beginning the golden age of video arcade games.[52] According to The Observer, the home console versions were popular and encouraged users to learn programming; many who later became industry leaders.[46] 1UP.com stated that Space Invaders showed that video games could compete against the major entertainment media at the time: movies, music, and television.[18] IGN attributed the launch of the arcade phenomenon in North America in part to Space Invaders.[53] Electronic Games credited the game's success as the impetus behind video gaming becoming a rapidly growing hobby and as \"the single most popular coin-operated attraction of all time.\"[54] Game Informer considered it, along with Pac-Man, one of the most popular arcade games that tapped into popular culture and generated excitement during the golden age of arcades.[55] IGN listed it as one of the \"Top 10 Most Influential Games\" in 2007, citing the source of inspiration to video game designers and the impact it had on the shooting genre.[56] 1UP ranked it at No. 3 in its list of \"The 60 Most Influential Games of All Time,\" stating that, in contrast to earlier arcade games which \"were attempts to simulate already-existing things,\" Space Invaders was \"the first video game as a video game, instead of merely a playable electronic representation of something else.\"[57] In 2008, Guinness World Records listed it as the top-rated arcade game in technical, creative, and cultural impact.[10]As one of the earliest shooting games, it set precedents and helped pave the way for future titles and for the shooting genre.[56][58] Space Invaders popularized a more interactive style of gameplay with the enemies responding to the player controlled cannon's movement,[15] and was the first video game to popularize the concept of achieving a high score,[4][45][56] being the first to save the player's score.[56] While earlier shooting games allowed the player to shoot at targets, Space Invaders was the first in which targets could fire back at the player.[59] It was also the first game where players were given multiple lives,[60] had to repel hordes of enemies,[18] could take cover from enemy fire, and use destructible barriers,[61] in addition to being the first game to use a continuous background soundtrack, with four simple diatonic descending bass notes repeating in a loop, which was dynamic and changed pace during stages,[62] like a heartbeat sound that increases pace as enemies approached.[63]It also moved the gaming industry away from Pong-inspired sports games grounded in real-world situations towards action games involving fantastical situations.[64] Whittaker commented that Space Invaders helped action games become the most dominant genre on both arcades and consoles, through to contemporary times.[65] Guinness World Records considered Space Invaders one of the most successful arcade shooting games by 2008.[45] In describing it as a \"seminal arcade classic\", IGN listed it as the number eight \"classic shoot 'em up\".[53] Space Invaders set the template for the shoot 'em up genre.[64] Its worldwide success created a demand for a wide variety of science fiction games, inspiring the development of arcade games, such as Atari's Asteroids,[66] Williams Electronics' Defender, and Namco's Galaxian and Galaga, which were modeled after Space Invaders '​s gameplay and design.[67][68] This influence extends to most shooting games released to the present day,[18] including first-person shooters such as Wolfenstein,[69][70] Doom,[71] Halo[72] and Call of Duty.[73] Space Invaders also had an influence on early computer dungeon crawl games such as Dungeons of Daggorath, which used similar heartbeat sounds to indicate player health.[63]Space Invaders has been remade on numerous platforms and spawned many sequels. Re-releases include ported and updated versions of the original arcade game. Ported versions generally feature different graphics and additional gameplay options—for example, moving defense bunkers, zigzag shots, invisible aliens, and two-player cooperative gameplay.[11] Ports on earlier systems like the Atari home consoles featured simplified graphics, while later systems such as the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and PlayStation featured updated graphics. Later titles include several modes of gameplay and integrate new elements into the original design. For example, Space Invaders Extreme, released on the Nintendo DS and PlayStation Portable, integrated musical elements into the standard gameplay.[74][75] A spin-off for WiiWare, Space Invaders Get Even, allows players to control the aliens instead of the laser cannon.[76]Taito has released several arcade sequels that built upon the basic design of the original. The first was Space Invaders Part II in 1979;[78][79] it featured color graphics, an attract mode, and new gameplay elements, and added an intermission between gameplay.[80] According to the Killer List of Video Games, this was the first video game to include an intermission.[45][80] The game also allowed the player with the top score to sign their name on the high score table.[81] This version was released in the United States as Deluxe Space Invaders (also known as Space Invaders Deluxe), but featured a different graphical color scheme and a lunar-city background. Another arcade sequel, titled Space Invaders II, was released exclusively in the United States. It was in a cocktail-table format with very fast alien firing and a competitive two-player mode. During the summer of 1985, Return of the Invaders was released with updated color graphics, and more complex movements and attack patterns for the aliens.[11] Subsequent arcade sequels included Super Space Invaders '91, Space Invaders DX, and Space Invaders  '​95. Each game introduced minor gameplay additions to the original design. Like the original game, several of the arcade sequels have become collector's items, though some are considered rarer.[33] In 2002, Taito released Space Raiders, a third-person shooter reminiscent of Space Invaders.[82][83]The game and its related games have been included in video game compilation titles. Space Invaders Anniversary was released in 2003 for the PlayStation 2 and included nine Space Invader variants.[84] A similar title for the PlayStation Portable, Space Invaders Pocket, was released in 2005.[85] Space Invaders, Space Invaders Part II and Return of the Invaders are included in Taito Legends, a compilation of Taito's classic arcade games released in 2005 on the PlayStation 2, Xbox, and PC.[86][87] Super Space Invaders '91, Space Invaders DX and Space Invaders  '​95 were included in Taito Legends 2, a sequel compilation released in 2006.[88]Many publications and websites use the pixelated alien graphic as an icon for video games in general, including video game magazine Electronic Gaming Monthly, technology website Ars Technica, and concert event Video Games Live.[18] There have also been Space Invaders themed merchandising, including necklaces and puzzles.[89]The game—and references to it—has appeared in numerous facets of popular culture. Soon after the game's release, hundreds of favourable articles and stories about the emerging video game medium popularized by Space Invaders aired on television and were printed in newspapers and magazines. The Space Invaders Tournament, held by Atari in 1980 and won by Bill Heineman,[90] was the first electronic sports event and attracted more than 10,000 participants, establishing video gaming as a mainstream hobby.[66] The Arcade Awards ceremony was created that same year to honour the best video games, with Space Invaders winning the first Game of the Year award.[91] The impact of Space Invaders on the video game industry has been compared to that of The Beatles in the pop music industry.[92] Considered \"the first blockbuster video game,\" Space Invaders became synonymous with video games worldwide for some time.[93]Within a year of the game's release, the Japanese PTA unsuccessfully attempted to ban the game for allegedly inspiring truancy.[27] In North America, doctors identified a condition called the \"Space Invaders elbow\" as a complaint,[94] while a physician in The New England Journal of Medicine named a similar ailment the \"Space Invaders Wrist.\"[95] Space Invaders was also the first game to attract political controversy, when a 1981 Private Member's Bill called the \"Control of Space Invaders (and other Electronic Games) Bill\" drafted by British Labour Party MP George Foulkes attempted to ban the game for its \"addictive properties\" and for causing \"deviancy\"; a motion to bring the bill before Parliament was briefly debated but defeated by 114 votes to 94 votes – the bill itself was never considered by Parliament.[96][97][98]Musicians drew inspiration for their music from Space Invaders. Video Games Live performed audio from the game as part of a special retro \"Classic Arcade Medley\".[99]The pioneering Japanese synthpop group Yellow Magic Orchestra reproduced Space Invaders sounds in its 1978 self-titled album and its hit single \"Computer Game\",[100] the latter selling over 400,000 copies in the United States.[101]Other pop songs based on Space Invaders soon followed, including disco records such as \"Disco Space Invaders\" (1979) by Funny Stuff,[100] and the hit songs \"Space Invader\" (1980) by The Pretenders,[100] \"Space Invaders\" (1980) by Uncle Vic[102] and the Australian hit \"Space Invaders\" (1979) by Player One (known in the US as Playback),[103] which in turn provided the bassline for Jesse Saunders' \"On and On\" (1984),[104][105] the first Chicago house music track.[106]Space Invaders is referenced in the lyrics to Rush's 1981 hit song \"Tom Sawyer,\" and the game is singled out for special thanks in the liner notes to the band's Permanent Waves album.[107]The game was also sampled in I-F's \"Space Invaders Are Smoking Grass\" (1997),[108] the first electroclash record.[109]In honor of the game's 30th anniversary, Taito produced an album titled Space Invaders 2008. The album is published by Avex Trax and features music inspired by the game.[110] Taito's store Taito Station also unveiled a Space Invaders themed music video.[111]Space Invaders will be appearing in the upcoming film Pixels and a film version of the game is in the works by Warner Bros with Akiva Goldsman produced.[120][121]Various books have been published about Space Invaders, including Space Invaders: An addict’s guide to battle tactics, big scores and the best machines (1982) by Martin Amis;[122] Tomb Raiders and Space Invaders: Videogame forms and Contexts, by Geof King and Tanya Krzywinska (2006), and Space Invaders (1980) by Mark Roeder and Julian Wolanski[123]In the same year, Space Invaders was included in the London Science Museum's Game On exhibition meant to showcase the various aspects of video game history, development, and culture.[126]At the Belluard Bollwerk International 2006 festival in Fribourg, Switzerland, Guillaume Reymond created a three-minute video recreation of a game of Space Invaders as part of the \"Gameover\" project using humans as pixels.[128]The GH ART exhibit at the 2008 Games Convention in Leipzig, Germany, included an art game, Invaders!, based on Space Invaders '​s gameplay. The creator later asked for the game to be removed from the exhibit following criticism of elements based on the September 11 attacks in the United States.[129]","title":"Space Invaders","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/0f/Space_Invaders_flyer%2C_1978.jpg/220px-Space_Invaders_flyer%2C_1978.jpg","developer":"Taito","genre":"Fixed shooter"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Aleste","description":"","title":"Super Aleste\nSpace Megaforce","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/8c/SpaceMegaforceBoxShot.jpg","developer":"Compile","genre":"scrolling shooter"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanky%27s_Quest","description":"","title":"Spanky's Quest","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/01/SpankysquestSNES_boxart.jpg/220px-SpankysquestSNES_boxart.jpg","developer":"Natsume","genre":"Action"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparkster","description":"","title":"[hide]","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/ab/Sparkster_North_American_SNES_box_art.jpg/256px-Sparkster_North_American_SNES_box_art.jpg","developer":"Konami","genre":"Platformer"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectre_(video_game)","description":"Spectre was a computer game for the Apple Macintosh, developed in 1990 by Peninsula Gameworks and published in 1991 by Velocity Development.

A Sega Game Gear version was planned, but ultimately scrapped, though a prototype version was leaked online.Based on the Spirou et Fantasio comic book series it features the adventure of Spirou trying to save his kidnapped friend Count Champignac and stop his arch-enemy Cyanida from making robots rule the earth.The game was noted for its good graphics and for being faithful to Spirou et Fantasio the comic book series, but due to the relatively high difficulty, most reviewers only recommended the game for true fans of the comic book series.Spirou, a journalist, and his friend Fantasio visit New York for an international conference of scientific research. When the pair arrives at the conference, Count Champignac, their long-time friend and one of the inventors at the conference, has disappeared. It turns out that Cyanide, a robot and one of Spirou's long time enemies, has kidnapped the count.[2] With Count Champignac's inventions, Cyanide's intention is to make robots rule the earth and make all humans into slaves. While Spirou tries to save Champignac and stop Cyanida, Fantasio gathers intel in order to help Spirou.[7]Spirou is a platformer type of video game where the main character with the same name can walk, run, jump and duck. In order to reach some areas he can dive and slide on the ground for a distance. Also, he can shoot with a gun called the Micropulser that is earned in the fourth level of the game.[8] Spirou can swim in the underwater levels apparent in the game.[9]Spirou has a health bar that allows him to take six hits before he loses a life. If the player has extra lives left when losing a life, the level restarts completely. If there are no extra lives left, the game is over.[10] An extra life is earned by collecting 50 Spirou hats, which are scattered throughout the eight levels.[5][6] Collecting a heart refills his health bar by one point. While diving under the water, Spirou can only hold his breath for a certain amount of time. The time under water can be extended by collecting oxygen bottles.[11]The Mega Drive, SNES and Game Boy versions of Spirou were reviewed in several video game magazines in France and Germany. It was generally well received, most critics noting the graphics and fluid animations in both the console and Game Boy versions. In addition, the soundtrack and varying gameplay fared well with critics and the controls of the game were noted for being precise and easy to use. Most critics also considered the game to be faithful to the comic series. On the other hand, the difficulty level of the gameplay was criticized for being too high. Also, due to the inclusion of only one password to save progress some reviewers meant that too many levels had to be replayed to get to the point in the game where the player previously was. In the end, most reviewers recommended the game for hardcore fans of the genre.[b]","title":"Spirou","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/12/Spirou_SNES_1996_front_cover_art.jpg/250px-Spirou_SNES_1996_front_cover_art.jpg","developer":"Infogrames Entertainment","genre":"Platformer"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Sporting_News:_Power_Baseball&action=edit&redlink=1","description":"Other reasons this message may be displayed:\n","title":"","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b4/Wiktionary-logo-en.png/28px-Wiktionary-logo-en.png","developer":"","genre":""},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_Illustrated:_Championship_Football_%26_Baseball","description":"Sports Illustrated: Championship Football & Baseball (known in Europe as All-American Championship Football) is a multiplatform sports video game that is licensed by the leading sports magazine, Sports Illustrated, which features both American football and baseball games.","title":"Sports Illustrated: Championship Football & Baseball","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/98/Sports-Illustrated-snes.jpg/220px-Sports-Illustrated-snes.jpg","developer":"Malibu Interactive","genre":"Sports"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Fox_(video_game)","description":"","title":"Star Fox/Starwing","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/52/Star_Fox_SNES.jpg/250px-Star_Fox_SNES.jpg","developer":"Nintendo EAD","genre":"Rail shooter"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_Deep_Space_Nine#Games","description":"Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (sometimes abbreviated to ST: DS9 or DS9) is a science fiction television series set in the Star Trek universe.The show is set in the Milky Way galaxy, in the years 2369 – 2375. In contrast to the setting of the other Star Trek TV shows, it takes place on a space station instead of a starship, so as not to have two series with starships at the same time (the starship USS Defiant was introduced in season 3, but the station remained the primary setting for the show). This made continuing story arcs and the appearance of recurring characters much more feasible. The show is noted for its well-developed characters, its original, complex plots, religious themes and for starring the only African American captain of all the Star Trek series to be featured as the show's protagonist. The series concentrated on darker themes, less physical exploration of space, and (in later seasons) an emphasis on many aspects of war.DS9 premiered in 1993 and ran for seven seasons until 1999. Rooted in Gene Roddenberry’s Star Trek universe, it was the first Trek spin-off created without direct involvement from Roddenberry, although he did give his blessing to the concept shortly before his death in 1991. The series was created by Rick Berman and Michael Piller, at the request of Brandon Tartikoff, and was produced by Paramount Television. Key writers, in addition to Berman and Piller, included showrunner Ira Steven Behr, Robert Hewitt Wolfe, Ronald D. Moore, Peter Allan Fields, Bradley Thompson, David Weddle, Hans Beimler, and René Echevarria.DS9 began while Star Trek: The Next Generation was still on the air and there were a few crossover episodes between the two shows. The station's first appearance in TNG was during the sixth season episode \"Birthright.\" In addition, two Next Generation characters, Miles O'Brien and (from Season 4 onwards) Worf, became regular members of DS9. The station also appeared in the Star Trek: Voyager pilot episode, \"Caretaker\".Conceived in 1991 shortly before Gene Roddenberry's death, DS9 centers on the formerly Cardassian space station Terok Nor. After the Bajorans have liberated themselves from the long and brutal Cardassian Occupation, the United Federation of Planets is invited by the Bajoran Provisional Government to administer joint control of the station, which initially orbits Bajor. The station is renamed Deep Space Nine.According to co-creator Berman, he and Piller had considered setting the new series on a colony planet, but they felt a space station would both appeal more to viewers and save money that would be required for on-location shooting for a \"land-based\" show. However, they were certain they did not want the show to be set aboard a starship because Star Trek: The Next Generation was still in production at the time and, in Berman’s words, it \"just seemed ridiculous to have two shows—two casts of characters—that were off going where no man has gone before.\"[1]In the pilot, the station is moved near the mouth of the newly discovered Bajoran wormhole, allowing access to the distant, unexplored Gamma Quadrant. It quickly becomes a center for exploration, interstellar trade, political maneuvering, and eventually open conflict.While its predecessors tended to restore the status quo ante at the end of each episode, allowing out-of-order viewing, DS9 contains story arcs that span shows—or seasons—and one installment often builds upon those that aired earlier, with several having cliffhanger endings. Michael Piller believed this to be one of the series' best qualities, allowing repercussions of past episodes to influence future events and remain with the show, forcing characters to \"learn that actions have consequences\".[1] This trend was especially noticeable toward the series' finale, by which time the show was scripted—intentionally—very much as a serial.[1][2]Unlike in Star Trek: The Next Generation, interpersonal conflicts were featured prominently in DS9. This was at the suggestion of Star Trek: The Next Generation '​s writers (many of whom also wrote for DS9) because they felt that the prohibition limited their ability to develop interesting stories. In Piller's words, \"people who come from different places—honorable, noble people—will naturally have conflicts\".[1]The setting of the show—a space station rather than a starship—fostered a rich assortment of recurring characters. It was not unheard of for \"secondary\" characters to play as much of a role in an episode as the regular cast, if not more. For example, \"The Wire\" focused almost entirely on Elim Garak, while \"Treachery, Faith, and the Great River\" featured Weyoun, with a secondary plot centered on Nog. \"It's Only a Paper Moon\" relied on Nog and holographic crooner Vic Fontaine (James Darren) to carry the story.Several Cardassian characters figure prominently in DS9, particularly Gul Dukat, the main villain of the series, played by Marc Alaimo. A complex character, he undergoes several transformations before ultimately becoming profoundly evil, and Sisko's archenemy by the show's conclusion. A StarTrek.com article about Star Trek's greatest villains described Gul Dukat as \"possibly the most complex and fully-developed bad guy in Star Trek history\".Elim Garak, portrayed by Andrew Robinson, is the only Cardassian who remains on the space station when the Federation and the Bajorans take over. Widely suspected of being an agent of the Obsidian Order, the feared Cardassian secret police, he maintains that he is merely a simple tailor. Garak's skills and contacts on Cardassia prove invaluable on several occasions, and he becomes a pivotal figure in the war with the Dominion.Damar (Casey Biggs) is initially a glinn serving under Gul Dukat aboard the freighter Groumall, later to become his loyal aide and rise in stature as Dukat regains prominence. He becomes the new leader of the Cardassian Union when Dukat has an emotional breakdown, precipitated by his daughter's death at the hands of Damar (\"Sacrifice of Angels\"). As the Dominion War progresses, Damar becomes increasingly dissatisfied with Cardassia's relationship with the Dominion. The tipping point is reached when the Dominion forms an alliance with the Breen and Cardassia is relegated to a secondary and increasingly marginalized role (\"Strange Bedfellows\"). Damar forms and leads an insurgency against the Dominion, playing a vital role in its eventual defeat (\"What You Leave Behind\").Jeffrey Combs (of Re-Animator fame) has stated that he had auditioned for the role of William Riker on Star Trek: The Next Generation, but when Jonathan Frakes (who won the part) later directed the DS9 episode \"Meridian\", he recommended Combs for a part.[6] Combs made his Star Trek and DS9 debut as a one-episode alien named Tiron, before being cast as the Ferengi Brunt and the Vorta Weyoun. He would go on to appear in thirty-one episodes of DS9, playing four distinct characters—five, if one counts the \"mirror universe\" version of Brunt. In \"The Dogs of War\", he also became one of the few Star Trek actors to play two distinct roles (Brunt and Weyoun) in the same episode. He also appeared in the series Star Trek: Enterprise, as the Andorian commander Shran. He is one of few people to have appeared in three of four modern Star Trek series.In addition to Quark and his brother Rom (Max Grodénchik), several other Ferengi had recurring roles, among them their shrewd mother Ishka (Andrea Martin, later Cecily Adams), who eventually engineers a social revolution on the Ferengi home world, Rom's son Nog (Aron Eisenberg), the first Ferengi to join Starfleet, and Grand Nagus Zek (Wallace Shawn), the Ferengi leader. Though she is Bajoran, the character Leeta (Chase Masterson), a Dabo girl in Quark's bar and later Rom's wife, is often involved with the Ferengi storyline. After Ishka's social revolution, Grand Nagus Zek names Rom as the Grand Nagus to lead the \"new\" Ferenginar.The Klingon Empire plays a more significant role in DS9 than in any other Star Trek series. Aside from Worf, recurring Klingon characters include Chancellor Gowron (Robert O'Reilly), leader of the Empire, who previously appeared in The Next Generation. In one of the series' final episodes, he was challenged and killed by Worf for sending Klingon troops on suicide missions to discredit General Martok (J. G. Hertzler) during the Dominion War; after killing Gowron, Worf passes leadership of the empire to Martok. Kor, a Klingon character from Star Trek: The Original Series resurfaces in three DS9 episodes. One of them, \"Blood Oath\", unites Kor with two other Klingons from the original series: Koloth and Kang. John Colicos, William Campbell, and Michael Ansara reprised their original series roles (Colicos is also notable for playing the key role of Count Baltar in the original Battlestar Galactica), and Michael Ansara for his starring roles in two previous series, Law of the Plainsman, and Broken Arrow.Morn is a minor character who is a fixture in a bar, spending seven years sitting at Quark's. According to The Star Trek Encyclopedia, it became a running joke that, despite the other characters' remarks on how talkative and funny he is, he never speaks a word on camera. Morn did have a line in the script for pilot episode \"Emissary\", but it was edited for episode run time, after which the creators conceived the joke that he never talks.[7]In the first episode, Starfleet Commander Benjamin Sisko arrives (along with his young son, Jake) at Deep Space Nine, a space station formerly run by the Cardassians during their oppressive occupation of Bajor, a planet which the space station orbits. He is assigned to run the station jointly with the newly liberated Bajorans as they recover from the Cardassian occupation, to help pave the way for Bajor's entry into the Federation. Sisko and Jadzia Dax stumble upon the first stable wormhole ever found and discover that it is inhabited by beings who are not bound by normal space and time. To the strongly religious people of Bajor, the wormhole aliens are their gods (the Prophets) and the wormhole itself is the long-prophesied Celestial Temple, where they reside. Sisko himself is hailed as the Emissary of the Prophets, through whom the Prophets primarily act.This provides the basis for a long-lasting story arc. Sisko initially considers his role as a religious icon with open discomfort and skepticism, referring to the Prophets simply as \"wormhole aliens\" and striving to keep his role as commander of the station distinct from any religious obligations that the Bajorans try to place on him. Later, he becomes more accepting of his role and, by the end of the series, he openly embraces it. The political and religious implications of this on the Bajorans and its spiritual leaders (most notably, Winn Adami) also provide a central arc that lasts until the end of the series.The station crew early on has to contend with a human resistance group known as the Maquis. Rooted in the events of The Next Generation episode \"Journey's End\", in which Native American settlers refuse to leave when their colony world is given to Cardassia as part of a treaty, the Maquis is an example for the show’s exploration of darker themes: its members are Federation citizens who take up arms against Cardassia in defense of their homes, and some—such as Calvin Hudson, a long-time friend of Sisko's, and Michael Eddington, who defects while serving aboard the station—are Starfleet officers. The show’s sharp departure from traditional Star Trek themes can be seen in episodes such as \"For the Cause\", in which Eddington complains to Sisko, \"Everybody should want to be in the Federation. Nobody leaves paradise. In some ways, you’re even worse than the Borg. At least they tell you about their plans for assimilation. You assimilate people and they don’t even know it.\" The Maquis also allows DS9 to subvert some longstanding Star Trek icons: Thomas Riker, a duplicate of Enterprise-D first officer Commander William Riker (also played by Jonathan Frakes; character first appeared in ST:TNG '​s \"Second Chances\" episode), is revealed in the episode \"Defiant\" to be a member of the Maquis who gains access to the station's crew and facilities by impersonating the Enterprise's Riker.The second-season episode, \"Rules of Acquisition\" marks the first mention of the Dominion, a ruthless empire in the Gamma Quadrant, though they are not fully introduced until the second-season finale, \"The Jem'Hadar\". It is led by \"the Founders\", a race of shape-shifting Changelings, the same race as station security chief Odo. They were once persecuted by non-shape-shifters (whom they call \"Solids\") and they seek to impose \"order\" upon any who could potentially harm them, which includes nearly all Solids. The Founders have created or genetically modified races to serve them: the Vorta, sly and subversive diplomats, and the Jem’Hadar, their fearless shock troops. These races worship the Founders as gods.At the start of DS9’s third season (\"The Search\"), with the threat of a Dominion attack looming from the other side of the wormhole, Commander Sisko returns from Starfleet Headquarters on Earth with the USS Defiant, a prototype starship that was originally built to fight the Borg. It remains stationed at Deep Space Nine until season seven, providing an avenue for plot lines away from the station. With the third season, writers from the now completed Next Generation began to write regularly for DS9.The Dominion forms an uneasy alliance with the Cardassians in the fifth-season episodes \"In Purgatory's Shadow\" and \"By Inferno's Light\" and goes to war with the other major powers of the Alpha Quadrant in the season finale \"Call to Arms\". Throughout the series, loyalties and alliances change repeatedly: pacts with the Cardassians are made, broken, and remade; a short war with the Klingons flares up and is settled, and the formerly neutral Romulans ally themselves with the Federation. This last alliance is made in an attempt to turn the war around, but comes as a result of criminal and duplicitous acts on Sisko and resident Cardassian Garak's part, thus providing an example of the moral ambiguity prevalent in DS9 in comparison to the other Star Trek series.Another example of DS9’s darker nature is the introduction of Section 31, a secret organization dedicated to preserving the Federation way of life at any cost. This shadow group, introduced in \"Inquisition\", justifies its unlawful, unilateral tactics by claiming that it is essential to the continued existence of the Federation. Section 31 repeatedly states that if you inquire into the matter with the Federation, they will deny Section 31's existence. Section 31 features prominently in several episodes of the Dominion War arc, especially as it is revealed that it attempted a genocide of the Founders.In DS9, the Ferengi are no longer an enemy of the Federation, but rather an economic power whose political neutrality is, for the most part, respected. A number of episodes explore their capitalistic nature, while others delve into the race’s sexist social norms. Unlike their depiction in Star Trek: The Next Generation, where they were generally portrayed simply as sexist buffoons for comedic purposes, in DS9 they received a more complex depiction, with the female partner (Ishka) of the Grand Nagus leading a women's rights rebellion on the Ferengi homeworld, and Rom, Quark's brother, leading a strike against unfair working conditions in Quark's bar. Also, Jake Sisko's best friend, Nog, has to deal with Starfleet's more liberal attitudes towards women while Jake learns to deal with his friend's cultural background in a respectful manner rather than risk the loss of their friendship. Nog later decides to join Starfleet, the first Ferengi to do so.Several episodes of DS9 explore the theme of the Mirror Universe, first touched upon in the TOS episode \"Mirror, Mirror\". In the second-season episode \"Crossover\", the DS9 crew first becomes aware of this alternate universe when Kira and Dr. Bashir experience operational difficulties while traveling through the Wormhole and wind up back on the station in the Mirror Universe dominated by the Klingon–Cardassian alliance. They discover that it is not DS9 to which they have returned but Terok Nor. Bajor is not friendly and there is no Federation here. \"Terrans\", as they are called in this universe, are ruthless barbarians according to the Intendant (Kira's mirror self) - the Terran Empire occupied Bajor for decades much as Cardassia had in the normal universe. The Klingon–Cardassian alliance eventually formed and Bajor was freed from Terran occupation, later enslaving Terrans as ore miners on the orbiting space station Terok Nor. Enslaved as they are, the Terran workers liberate themselves and form a resistance movement, as seen in several other DS9 episodes (\"Through the Looking Glass\", \"Shattered Mirror\", \"Resurrection\", \"The Emperor's New Cloak\").DS9 was the first Star Trek TV show to use computer-generated imagery (CGI) for exterior space shots, the second being Star Trek: Voyager, from Season 3 onward. Although a few other television series had used CGI exclusively to avoid the high expense of model photography, the Star Trek franchise continued primarily using models for exterior space shots, because it was felt models provided more realism. DS9 started using Foundation Imaging and Digital Muse in 1997 (Seasons 6 and 7) for its effects as part of the ongoing storyline of the Dominion occupation of the station. However, the Deep Space Nine station itself remained a physical model throughout the series' seven-year run except for the final scene of the series. In October 2006, the physical model of the station was sold for $132,000 in an auction at Christie's auction house in New York City.The opening sequence was likewise modified in the fourth season, most notably by the introduction of CGI inserts of construction work being performed on the station's exterior by suited maintenance crews, and more docking and launching activity by ships, along with subtle colored wisps of nebulae added to the background starfield. Accordingly, the solo trumpet (preceded by a solo French horn) featured prominently in the main theme by Dennis McCarthy to accentuate the lonely isolation of the outpost was now augmented by a chorus of brass as the station attained a more bustling atmosphere following the presence of the wormhole.The USS Defiant was the first full-fledged starship in the Star Trek franchise to have a CGI model used in regular production. It was first built and animated by VisionArt, which was responsible for the morphing of Odo. The CGI Defiant was featured heavily in the Season 4 episode \"Starship Down\", where it battled a CGI Jem'Hadar ship in a CGI gas giant's atmosphere.[8]Although DS9 '​s ratings remained solid, it was never as successful as the syndicated Star Trek: The Next Generation, with approximately 6% versus 11% of US households watched during sweeps months. However, it continued to perform better than its network sibling Star Trek: Voyager which averaged around 5% according to the Nielsen ratings.[9] One factor was the increasingly crowded syndicated marketplace, which provided viewers with a number of alternative television series to follow.[citation needed] Another factor was the minimal promotion for DS9, as Paramount focused its efforts on its flagship network show Star Trek: Voyager.[citation needed] Finally, from 1995 onwards, most of the independent stations joined new networks (UPN and WB), and these primetime shows gradually pushed syndicated programming into less favorable time slots as the US television market expanded from four networks (in 1987 when TNG premiered) to six.[citation needed]DS9 was well received by critics with TV Guide describing it as \"the best acted, written, produced and altogether finest\" Star Trek series.[10] Despite debuting in the shadow of The Next Generation, DS9 achieved a considerable level of success in its own right. According to a press release through Newswire on April 7, 1999, it was the #1 syndicated show in the United States for adults 18–49 and 25–54. The characters of DS9 were featured on the cover of TV Guide ten times during its run, including several \"special issue\" editions in which a set of four different-covered versions were printed.The series won a number of awards.[11] It was nominated for Emmy Awards every year of its run, including makeup, cinematography, art direction, special effects, hairstyling, music (direction and composition), and costumes. Of these, it won two for Makeup (for \"Captive Pursuit\" and \"Distant Voices\") and one for the Main Title Theme Music (Dennis McCarthy). It was also nominated for two Hugo Awards in Best Dramatic Presentation for \"The Visitor\" and \"Trials and Tribble-ations\".Deep Space Nine drew praise from African-American, Latino and other minority viewers for its handling of the minority characters, particularly the Sisko family members.[12] In addition, Alexander Siddig (Dr Bashir) expressed his enthusiasm for the fact that he, with his English accent, unusual screen name (Siddig El Fadil) at time of casting, and North African heritage, was a main character on a prominent TV show despite being not quite so easily racially identifiable as many other actor/characters on TV.[13]In a 2007 interview with iF Magazine, George Takei, who had played the character Sulu in The Original Series, criticized DS9 for being the polar opposite of Gene Roddenberry's philosophy and vision of the future.[14] However, D. C. Fontana stated in an interview that Roddenberry would have liked it and its dark themes, since he was a World War II veteran.[15] Bjo Trimble, one of the major forces behind the letter-writing campaign that helped renew the original series for its third season, commented that she thought Roddenberry would \"come to like DS9, had he lived to see it,\" and that \"the only reason there were not full battles in early Trek is lack of funds to pull it off, and lack of technology to show it. Otherwise, GR would certainly have added it; he knew what audiences liked\".[16]Roddenberry himself is quoted in The Making of Star Trek DS9 as having doubts that a non-exploration show could work, and being displeased with early concepts presented to him in 1991. However, Rick Berman stated in the Star Trek: Deep Space Nine Companion that Roddenberry had given him his blessing for developing it close to his death.At Shore Leave 14 in July 1992, Majel Barrett commented on Roddenberry's involvement, saying: \"Uh, he knew about it, but he was not about to become involved. He had done what he wanted to do and that was it. He just wished them Godspeed and go ahead. And as long as the name Star Trek is on it, yes, the estate will have a part of the action.\"[17]Ronald D. Moore, one of the show's main writers (who previously wrote for Star Trek: The Next Generation, and went on to create the re-imagined Battlestar Galactica), praised the show as the \"ultimate achievement for the [Star Trek] franchise\" in 2002:I think Deep Space [Nine] was the show that really took Star Trek as far as you could take it. You have the original series which is a sort of a landmark, it changes everything about the way science fiction is presented on television, at least space-based science fiction. Then you have Next Generation which, for all of its legitimate achievements is still a riff on the original. It's still sort of like, ok, it's another star ship and it's another captain – it's different but it's still a riff on the original. Here comes Deep Space [Nine] and it just runs the table in a different way. It just says ok, you think you know what Star Trek is, let's put it on a space station, and let's make it darker. Let's make it a continuing story, and let's continually challenge your assumptions about what this American icon means. And I think it was the ultimate achievement for the franchise. Personally, I think it's the best of all of them, I think it's an amazing piece of work.[18]On June 30, 1993, between seasons one and two, DS9 followed the example of other Star Trek series in releasing the original score from its pilot episode on CD. The title theme was also made available as a CD single. Music from several other episodes is included on the The Best of Star Trek releases.[19][20]Originally created in the hope that Frank Sinatra, Jr. would take the role[citation needed], the character Vic Fontaine (instead played by 1960s heart throb James Darren) was introduced in the sixth-season episode \"His Way\". The character was a self-aware holographic Las Vegas lounge singer and night club owner from the early 1960s. Vic was popular with the station's crew and performed many period songs by, among others, Frank Sinatra and Nat King Cole. Darren's role allowed him to release This One's from the Heart on August 24, 1999, featuring songs that Vic sang in the show and other period pieces.On February 12, 2013, La La Land Records released a limited edition, 4-disc soundtrack collection entitled the \"Star Trek: Deep Space Nine Collection\". The discs contain various cues from episodes scored by Dennis McCarthy, Jay Chattaway, David Bell, Paul Baillargeon, John Debney, Richard Bellis and Gregory Smith. Only 3000 copies of the collection were printed.[21][22]Episodes of DS9 were made available on VHS cassettes. The first release came on November 19, 1996 in the United States, but the line was discontinued once all of DS9 had been released on DVD. The series was released on VHS in the UK starting August 2, 1993. Each video box contained unique artwork and character/plot information.Beginning in 1996, DS9 began releases on LaserDisc. Picture and sound quality in this format was significantly better than that of VHS cassettes; however, the Laserdisc format was discontinued in 1997. Only the first, second and part of the third season were released in the format.Following the DVD release of Star Trek: The Next Generation in 2002, DS9 was released on DVD beginning in February 2003. DS9 was released in boxed sets of one season each and released about a month apart. Each season contains several \"special features\", including a biographical look at a main character, information from make-up designer Michael Westmore on how various aliens were created, and interviews with cast members and crew members.The sets also include \"Section 31\" easter eggs that give a brief look at other aspects of the show. The Region 2 & 4 DVDs also come with bonus CD-ROM discs that allow users to build a \"virtual\" DS9 on their computer with each release (this software can no longer be installed as the on-line registration is no longer available). On October 26, 2004, a compilation of all seven season sets was also released.Pocket Books has published several dozen books based on DS9. Some of these were novelizations of memorable episodes, such as \"Emissary\", \"The Search\" and \"What You Leave Behind\", which were usually published a few days after the episode aired in the United States. Several novels were part of \"crossover\" series between the Star Trek franchises, while others were part of other franchises but dealt with events laid out in DS9. For example, The Battle of Betazed tells of how Deanna Troi attempted to resist the Dominion occupation of her world (mentioned in the episode \"In the Pale Moonlight\"). Most focus on the station and its crew, with a notable exception being Ira Steven Behr and Robert Hewitt Wolfe’s Legends of the Ferengi.The \"Millennium\" series by Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens, published by Pocket Books beginning in 2000, consists of The Fall of Terok Nor (book 1), The War of the Prophets (book 2), and Inferno (book 3). The series lays out an alternate ending to DS9 (the novels were actually written before the series concluded) in which a second wormhole is created by the actions of a number of shady characters, destroying the station. In the space-time distortion that occurs, most of the crew are transported 25 years into the future—a future in which the Federation and its allies are virtually crushed and a fanatical sect of Bajorans who worships the Pah-wraiths have ascended to power and plan to destroy the universe to bring about a higher state of existence. Inferno ends the series as an unexpected mode of time travel is discovered after the end of the universe, allowing the DS9 crew to alter past events.Avatar, a two-part novel published on May 1, 2001, picked up where the series left off. It began season 8 of DS9, into which A Stitch in Time (a biographical look at the life of Garak, written by Andrew Robinson himself) was incorporated retroactively. The events of \"What You Leave Behind\", DS9’s series finale, caused some radical changes to occur in Season 8. As Benjamin Sisko had entered the Celestial Temple, Colonel Kira was given command of the station while a new commander named Elias Vaughn took over her position, Garak became the leader of post-war Cardassia, Odo helped the Changelings rebuild, and Rom presided over the Ferengi Alliance.Other publications, such as the Deep Space Nine Technical Manual and Deep Space Nine Companion, are common to most of the Trek series. The DS9 Companion contains detailed episode guides and interviews with actors, writers, directors and other staff members.DS9 series influences were included in role-playing game reference books from Last Unicorn Games and Decipher. Additionally, several novels have also been released in audio form, narrated by Rene Auberjonois and Armin Shimerman among others.Outside its line of novels, DS9 has been the subject of several comic books and other publications put out by Malibu Comics. One comic is a spin-off, detailing Nog’s experiences at the Starfleet Academy. Another DS9 comic book series became an exceptional example of licensed Star Trek works influencing each other, as a major character from Wildstorm Productions N-Vector, Tiris Jast, appeared in the Avatar, Part I novel.Several video games focusing on DS9 have been released. The first was Crossroads of Time, a 1995 side-scrolling game released for the Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis. The game takes place around the time of the series premiere, borrowing some stories from early episodes such as \"Past Prologue\" and creating others. A number of problems reportedly impeded the game's development process,[23] and it met with mixed reactions.Three DS9-themed games were released for the PC: Harbinger in 1996, The Fallen in 2000, and Dominion Wars in 2001. A board game was released as part of the now-defunct \"component board game\" series, which included an intercompatible board game for Star Trek: The Next Generation.[24] DS9 '​s role-playing book was one of several that failed to be released into wide circulation when Decipher, then publisher of the Star Trek role-playing game, discontinued its line.[citation needed]The series features prominently in the Star Trek Customizable Card Game, particularly its second edition. In the game's first edition, Deep Space Nine is the titular fifth set, followed by one entitled \"The Dominion\" and several other DS9-themed sets. In the second edition, there are two types of cards for the United Federation of Planets, which may be placed at Earth or Deep Space Nine. The Ferengi, Dominion, Cardassian, Bajoran, and Maquis affiliations are primarily DS9-derived material, while the Klingon affiliation also borrows strongly from it.[25]The newest Star Trek title[when?], Star Trek Online, features Deep Space Nine as a trading hub. The lower ring (The Promenade) contains vendors, and the upper ring offers views of surrounding space.Along with the rest of the Star Trek franchise, DS9 has been the subject of much merchandizing. Action figures, keychains, models, and other items have been released. The station itself, which is highly recognizable and iconic of the series, is the subject of many of these items. Paramount also sells Starfleet uniforms; among the styles is the so-called \"DS9-style\" uniform, which is primarily black with a division color (red for command, yellow for engineering or security, blue/green for medical and the sciences) on the shoulders.DS9 was well represented at Star Trek: The Experience, an attraction at the Las Vegas Hilton which recreated both Quark’s Bar & Restaurant and the Promenade. The former served Star Trek-style food and drinks, and hosted gatherings such as conventions. The latter (called the Shopping Promenade) sold various souvenirs and rarities; among the items for sale were \"official\" Starfleet uniforms and action figures. The attraction closed in September 2008.","title":"","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/3c/DS9logo.JPG","developer":"","genre":""},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_Starfleet_Academy_Starship_Bridge_Simulator","description":"","title":"Star Trek: Starfleet Academy\nStarship Bridge Simulator","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/1f/Star_Trek_Starfleet_Cover.jpg/250px-Star_Trek_Starfleet_Cover.jpg","developer":"High Voltage Software","genre":""},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_The_Next_Generation:_Future%27s_Past","description":"Star Trek: The Next Generation: Future's Past (Star Trek: The Next Generation: Echoes from the Past on Sega) is a 1994 adventure game featuring strategy and puzzle-solving elements.

The game's helicopter is equipped with a machine gun, rockets, and a limited number of air-to-surface guided missiles. Several missions are available for play. Completing early missions unlocks later missions.The Illustration for the Lynx System package showing the Steel Talons attack helicopter in action, was created by Marc Ericksen for Atari.

The back of the seat had a speaker which would thump when the player took enemy fire.

The series also had a video game on the Super Nintendo. It served as a late attempt to market the troll doll craze of the early 1990s to young boys. While not particularly successful, nor inspired by a prior medium, Stone Protectors generally followed in the same vein as contemporaries like Toxic Crusaders, Swamp Thing, and the highly popular Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.A kingdom built of crystals came under attack by the Saurians whose leader, Zok, desired the powerful crystals protected by the Queen. Zok broke into the castle and reached for the crystals only to see them explode into pieces and fly to Earth.After being thrown out the back door of a New York club, an awful rock band known as the Rock Detectors found the five magical stones which gave them troll-like appearances and special skills (not the least of which is playing good music). This put them at odds with the music-hating Zok and his henchman Zink, collectively known as The Predators.A short-lived cartoon series based on the characters debuted in 1993. In it, Princess Opal of Mythrandir splits the legendary Great Crystal into six pieces to keep it out of Zok's hands. Zok manages to capture one piece, but the other five bond with the future Stone Protectors, spiriting them away to Mythrandir to help Opal upset Zok's schemes and spread a sentiment of peace and freedom with their music. The series lasted one season; 8 out of 13 episodes were released on VHS in 1994 by Family Home Entertainment.It's notable that while the advertisements for the action figures attempted to tie the Stone Protectors into the troll doll fad, the cartoon seemed eager to avoid the comparison. For instance, it replaced the line \"trolls on a roll\" from the theme song in the commercials with \"Don't you know?\"The Stone Protectors action figures were produced by the Ace Novelty Toy Company. All of the figures were roughly 5\" tall and featured cut joints at the neck, shoulders, and elbows as well as ball joints at the hips. Their heads were a soft, rubbery material with tall, synthetic hair sticking straight out the top. In rotating the right arm of a Stone Protectors figure, a flint module would ignite inside its chest, creating a quick yet bright flash seen through the translucent chest emblem. A second series of sports-themed figures was also released. Princess Opal was never made as a figure, nor were there any generic Saurian Guards.Unfortunately, the toyline as well as the cartoon that followed it were seen as poor imitations of the popular Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles line of toys and cartoon series and overlooked by many.A Super Nintendo game based on the property was released in November 1994 by Kemco.[1] A Sega Mega Drive/Genesis version was developed and completed, but not released. This version, intended to be published by Vic Tokai, was made when ESRB was in place and had a T rating. It featured alternate case and cartridge artwork than the SNES version. The fully finished Mega Drive/Genesis prototype was finally leaked to the public domain in 2010.Stone Protectors features 10 levels in which the heroes – Clifford, Cornelius, Chester, Maxwell, and Angus – battle The Predators throughout their mission to retrieve Zok's crystal and bring them all back to the kingdom. Weapons can also be acquired but only used by certain characters. Depending on the difficulty setting, the game's ending scene also features different music in which the Stone Protectors are seen performing as a band.The game has received moderately positive critiques in terms of crisp graphics, pleasant music, and accurate collision detection. On the other hand, Stone Protectors' plot and the repetitive nature of beat 'em up titles has led to criticisms of blandness. In December 1994, GamePro gave Stone Protectors a 3.5 out of 5 rating.[2]Pressman Toy Corp. released a Stone Protectors board game.[3] In late 1993, Harvey Comics debuted Stone Protectors \"Premiere Issue\" (effectively an issue #0), followed by issues #1–3.","title":"","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b6/StoneProtectorsVHS.jpg","developer":"Eurocom","genre":"Side-scrolling"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Ranma_%C2%BD_video_games#SNES","description":"A total of 15 video games based on the Ranma ½ manga and anime series exist, generally in the form of fighting games, RPGs, and puzzle games.

The game was a success on the SNES and Mega Drive and received mixed reviews across platforms.Street Racer is a go-kart racing game which combines racing with violence.[3] Characters can strike opponents with their fists and must avoid explosives littered around the track.[3][7] The game's characters (including Surf Sister and Frank Instein)[8] possess unique power-ups such as the Screaming Banshee, Batmobile,[8] magic carpet and tri-plane.[6]Street Racer was a \"top SNES game\"[6] and \"highly successful\" on the Mega Drive according to Amiga Format.[9] Reviewing the Amiga version, Andy Smith of Amiga Format complained of the soccer mode: \"Your car moves as if it's in treacle while everyone else seems to be on greased rails\". The reviewer said the soccer mode was \"bizarre and, frankly, not much fun\". He called the rumble mode \"even less exciting\" and said of the game overall \"It's not that it's a complete pig or anything, it's just that it promises so much and manages to deliver so little\". Smith said the \"good tracks\" of the \"top SNES game\" version had been \"sacrificed\" for \"decent speed\" and complained that this speed ruined the cornering mechanics. He said the background graphics were attractive but the animations \"jerky\" and wrote: \"Well done chaps, you've made a crap racing game with some nice backgrounds.\" He also called the music \"dreadful\" and sound effects \"crap\", awarding 45%.[6] CU Amiga Magazine complained that the tracks were shallow, but contended the game's appeal was in combating other characters. The reviewer noted the \"pretty intense\" action of the rumble mode and said the football mode did not live up to its potential but was a \"pretty reasonable\" distraction. The magazine said the game was simple but \"demented fun\" and praised its variety, awarding 87%.[10]GameSpot, reviewing the PlayStation version, called the game \"mildly entertaining\" and said \"It's good enough for a weekend rental, but not much more.\" The website awarded a \"mediocre\" score of 5.8.[3] Sega Saturn Magazine found \"the characters a bit tacky and the characters largely derivative\" but praised the game's artificial intelligence and variety of game modes. The magazine called the graphics \"very nice indeed, colourful and rich in detail\" but said \"racing tends to give you the impression that the road is moving while the car remains stationary.\" The reviewer compared the game to Mario Kart, saying \"It lacks the overall accessibility of the Super NES classic and the course design isn't quite as innovative.\" The reviewer said \"Street Racer remains very playable and challenging and is especially fun in multi-player mode\" and awarded 82%.[11] Other critics also noted that the game was inspired by Mario Kart,[6][10] with Esquire calling it a \"likeable clone, boasting more cartoon characters in the kind of no-holds-barred go-kart race you dream of having when you come home from the pub with your chums.\"[12]","title":"Street Racer","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/11/Street_Racer_Coverart.png","developer":"Vivid Image","genre":"Racing"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_Gunner_S.T.G","description":"Strike Gunner S.T.G (エス・ティー・ジー?) is a vertical scrolling shoot 'em up video game originally released on the arcades in 1991 by Tecmo, and then later ported for the Super Nintendo.

It was the second game to use the 3D-centric Super FX powered GSU-1.There are three vehicles to choose from originally (F-Type, COUPE, and 4WD), as well as a fourth one that is unlockable (2WD); a fifth vehicle is only used in bonus games (TRAILER). Stunt Race FX's use of eyes on the vehicles was a late-in-development addition, to give character to otherwise personality-free cars. Each vehicle has different capabilities in terms of speed, body and acceleration. According to the instruction booklets in English, the vehicles are male; however, according to the Japanese instruction manual and the Japanese television commercial, the COUPE is female and every other vehicle is male.The capabilities of the Super FX chip are demonstrated extensively in Stunt Race FX. Each course appears to be constructed with 3D polygons, complete with road bumps and overhead passes, resulting in a considerably large number of animation screens. Detailed billboard advertisements also appear throughout each race course. These realistic representations are possible on the Super NES because the Super FX chip renders 2D sprites in a visual format that resembled 3D polygons. Under this format, polygons do not \"crash\" together to become distorted, though the graphics run slower. This lack of speed is incorporated into the gameplay by featuring cars that are heavier and clumsier than those included in conventional racing games.In 1991, Nintendo began developing a custom 3D cartridge chip called the Super FX chip with Dylan Cuthbert from Argonaut Software (who is now at Q-Games) as their assistant, so that it could be used in Super NES games to create polygonal 3D graphics. The first game that used the Super FX was Star Fox, which became a success. After the release of Star Fox, Nintendo and Argonaut began conducting various experiments throughout the co-development of the Super FX chip. The development of Stunt Race FX, which was tentatively titled as FX Trax back then,[2] started when Giles Goddard and Colin Reed joined in and later became Nintendo employees. Nintendo used the polygon concept to create a 3D-animated racing game filled with high-flying stunts and obstacles, as well as normal racing. While the game was solid, the overall product quality and timing of release weren't favorable to its success. Nintendo has since discontinued the idea of franchising the series. The one prior incident took form with a canceled sequel on the Nintendo 64 called Buggie Boogie.[3] Wataru Yamaguchi (山口亘?) created the official clay models of the Stunt Race FX vehicles used on the Japanese version's box art and the instruction booklet of all versions.[4]Around the time Stunt Race FX was released in the United States, Nintendo of America teamed up with Kellogg's and Mattel[9] to give away a promotional, Hot Wheels brand, F-Type race car to people who mailed two proofs from boxes of Apple Jacks to Kellogg's to receive it for free. The television commercial for it showed the toy car move across a kitchen table in front of a box of Apple Jacks while a young, blonde-haired boy wearing glasses looks at the toy car from behind the box of Apple Jacks. At the same time, the announcer in the commercial said, \"Now you can get the Super NES Stunt Race FX car free, with two proofs from Kellogg's Apple Jacks.\" Followed by a pit crew refilling the boy's bowl with Apple Jacks and milk and taking care of other things around him like clearing his glasses while the announcer said \"It's almost like the real thing.\"[10] The limited-edition F-Type car have been quite rare, especially if still factory-sealed. It is a repaint of an existing Hot Wheels car called Shock Factor, which had already resembled F-Type.Despite the game's sales, popularity and marketing all being poor, most reviews of the game were positive. Nintendo Magazine System UK, a British magazine gave it a nearly perfect 9.5 out of 10. In Vol. 2 issue 5 of Game Zero, another video game magazine, the game scored a 94 out of 100, saying the controls are \"out of this world!\" and the \"attention to detail is truly superior\".[18] Edge gave it a 9 out of 10 rating, while stating that Stunt Race FX is \"one of the best racing games currently available for any home system.\" In season 3's third episode of a mid 1990s British factual television programme Bad Influence!, a few reviewers combined their ratings into an overall score of 4 out of 5.[16] AllGame, an online video game website, gave it a 3.5 out of 5.[15]However, on the negative side, GamePro gave it a 72% and thought Stunt Race FX wasn't realistic. They also thought the racing game \"still delivers a good time, especially if you're not old enough to drive.\"[11][17] Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the game a 6.5 out of 10. EGM responded positively to the game's track design, though criticized the game for the controls, thinking Stunt Race FX \"feels awkward with the touchy steering\" and not being as fast as most other racing games.Wild Trax - Rare Tracks for Driving is the soundtrack for Stunt Race FX. The album was a collection of original music composed by Shinobu Amayake, as well as many sound effects. It also included arranged music by Yoshiyuki Ito and Akira Hoshi, and was released by Sony Records only in Japan on September 21, 1994.[20] The album is currently quite rare.","title":"Stunt Race FX","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/64/StuntraceSNES_boxart.jpg/220px-StuntraceSNES_boxart.jpg","developer":"Nintendo EAD","genre":"Arcade racing"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunset_Riders","description":"Sunset Riders (サンセットライダーズ Sansetto Raidāzu?) is a side-scrolling run-and-gun style shoot-'em-up released by Konami as a coin-operated video game in 1991.

Home versions of Sunset Riders were released for the Sega Mega Drive (Genesis) in 1992 and for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in 1993.Sunset Riders can be played by up to two or four players, depending on the version of the game. In the 2-player version each player can choose which of the four bounty hunters (Steve, Billy, Bob, and Cormano) to play as at the start of the game, while in the 4-player version each character is assigned to a different control panel. Steve and Billy wield revolvers, while Bob and Cormano use shotguns. The controls consists of an eight way joystick for moving the character and aiming their guns, and two buttons for shooting and jumping. The player can jump between higher and lower floors by holding the joystick up or down while pressing the jump button. There's also a slide move that allows the player's character to avoid enemy fire by pressing the jump button while the joystick diagonally downwards.[1]The Mega Drive/Genesis version of Sunset Riders features the most changes made to the game between the two home versions of the game. Out of the four main characters from the arcade game, only Billy and Cormano are featured. The two characters in the Genesis version were given surnames that they originally didn't have in the arcade version (Billy Cool and Cormano Wild).[2][3] The controls are identical to the arcade version aside from the addition of two shooting buttons instead of just one: one button allows the player to walk and shoot at the same time, while the other shoot button keeps the character still when pressed down, allowing the player to change their aim only.[4]In contrast to the Genesis version, the SNES version of Sunset Riders features relatively few changes. The barfly that kisses the player character in Stage 1 as well as the saloon dancers from Stage 4 are dressed more conservatively compared to the arcade version. Hunter dogs, which were present in first segment of the final chapter in the Genesis version, were removed. Also, the Native American enemy characters from Stage 6 were removed and replaced with regular outlaws, leaving only Chief Scalpem (who is renamed Chief Wigwam and re-voiced in the SNES game) as the stage boss. The dynamite tossing female bandits were replaced with male bandits in the SNES port as well.","title":"Sunset Riders","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/39/Sunset_Riders_arcade_flyer.jpg","developer":"Konami","genre":"Run and gun"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Adventure_Island","description":"Super Adventure Island (高橋名人の大冒険島, Takahashi Meijin no Daibōken Jima?, \"Great Takahashi's Great Adventure Island\") is a side-scrolling platform game by Hudson Soft originally released for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in 1992 and later re-released for the Wii's Virtual Console download service in 2011.

The game is strictly single-player and is primarily a strategy game with some real-time elements. It is based on the Battleship board game by the Milton Bradley Company.The game features two modes: Super Battleship mode and Classic Battleship mode. Classic Battleship mode is essentially an electronic version of the board game Battleship, where you play against the computer because the game is strictly single-player.Super Battleship is a naval simulator played by sailing ships to a close enough range to shoot an opponent's ships and cities. Super Battleship contains 16 missions that must be completed within a certain amount of rounds. Ships have four different weapons: missiles, torpedoes, depth charges, and guns. The game is turn-based with each side giving movement and attack orders within a time limit. A turn ends when either the time limit expires or all ships receive orders. Actual combat occurs within real-time: guns and torpedoes are fired at surface ships while the opponent can fire back. Depth charges are dropped on submerged submarines. Cruise missiles move erratically and must be guided to the target. Crewmen can be assigned to repair ships' damaged systems. Ships resupply by capturing bases and storehouses.Aside from the battles taking place in real-time, Super Battleship is essentially a strategy game with a relatively slow pace. It also provides no background and very little storyline. The four ships are the same as those in Classic Battleship (PT Boat, Cruiser, Destroyer, Battleship)[3] but only the enemy gets to use submarines.","title":"Super Battleship","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/ac/Super_Battleship_SNES_cover.jpg/220px-Super_Battleship_SNES_cover.jpg","developer":"","genre":"Strategy"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Battletank","description":"Super Battletank is a 1992 tank simulation single-player video game which takes place during Operation Desert Storm.

It is also the first four-player game to be released on the Super NES.The basic gameplay involved in Super Bomberman is relatively simple. The game takes place on a single non-scrolling screen. The screen shows the top down view of a grid of 143 squares. The grid restricts the movement of characters so they can only move horizontally or vertically around the screen. Pressing the 'A' button will make your Bomberman drop a bomb at his feet. This bomb will pulse for a few seconds (allowing you time to run away) and then explode, shooting flames horizontally and vertically. The game revolves around the idea of using these bomb blasts to destroy walls and enemies.Super Bomberman was originally bundled with a multitap device to allow more than 2 players to play simultaneously. The Super Multitap was long and grey with four controller ports in a row on one side. It plugged into either of the controller ports on the SNES deck. This meant a total of 5 controllers could be plugged in with the fifth controller plugged into 2nd port on the SNES. Although Super Bomberman, as well as Super Bomberman 2, only allowed the use of the first 4 controllers to play the game, other Bomberman games: 3, 4 and 5 allowed to use three to five controllers and the 5th controller would allow a sound test to be accessed by pressing the R shoulder button on the option screen.Hudson later released a second multitap (the Super Multitap 2) on its own for people that had purchased Super Bomberman unbundled, or one of the other multitap enabled games. This second version was designed in the shape of a Bomberman's head and had the two controller ports on the front and one on each side. It was also designed to be used with future games. Eventually there were 54 Super NES games that utilised the multitap. However, they were predominately sports games.[1]The four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly gave Super Bomberman a unanimous score of 9 out of 10 and their \"Game of the Month\" award, and asserted that the game's addictiveness is on the same order as that of Tetris. They further commented that the game is great fun even in single player mode, but that the highlight is the multiplayer.[4]","title":"Super Bomberman","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/7a/Super.Bomberman.Box.Art.SNES.PAL.png/250px-Super.Bomberman.Box.Art.SNES.PAL.png","developer":"Hudson Soft","genre":"Action"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bomberman_2","description":"Super Bomberman 2 (スーパーボンバーマン2, Sūpā Bonbāman Tsū?) is the second of five video games in the Bomberman series developed by Hudson Soft to be released for the Super Famicom/SNES.

Two spin-offs were also released: Crime City (1989) and Quiz H.Q.

Gameplay is modeled on the original with some aspects of S.C.I. incorporated. There is also a Super Chase H.Q. for the Game Boy, which was released exclusively in North America, in 1994. The game is similar to the Game Boy's Taito Chase H.Q. (1991).In 2000, Chase H.Q.

It also earned two spin-offs - the run and gun Crime City, and the quiz game Quiz H.Q..Super Chase: Criminal Termination was the third arcade release in the Chase H.Q. series, released in 1992. Unlike prior games, the protagonist's vehicle was commanded from a first-person view.In February 2006, Chase H.Q. : Nancy Yori Kinkyuu Renraku (English: Chase H.Q. - An Urgent Call From Nancy) was presented at the Arcade Operator's Union trade show in Tokyo.[11] The game was released as Chase H.Q. 2 later in the year.Saint Etienne recorded a demo dance track called \"Chase HQ\" that was inspired by Chase H.Q.

Particularly, the two characters have different basic punches (in the Japanese version, Jimmy's roundhouse kick is also different).Muneki Ebinuma, who worked as the lead game designer of Super Double Dragon, published a commentary about his involvement in the development of the game in 2004, where he detailed his original plans for the game　 that he was unable to fully realized due to time constraints. The game was supposed to feature cut-scenes prior to boss battles and between stages, as well as a full ending sequence, in contrast to the lack of in-game plot in the retail release (where no explanation is given as to why Billy and Jimmy Lee are fighting the enemy). The plot would've involved Billy and Jimmy Lee investigating a criminal organization known as the Shadow Warriors following the disappearances of several local martial artists, eventually coming face to face with their leader Duke, who would've been revealed to had been a childhood friend of the Lee brothers. The character of Marian was also supposed to appear in the game as a policewoman who assisted the Lee brothers (an occupation she had in the Double Dragon comic book and animated series produced around the time). While Marian is still mentioned in the instruction manual and packaging description, she never actually appears in the retail version of the game.

The first game of the Mario Kart series, it was launched in Japan on August 27, 1992, in North America on September 1, 1992, and in Europe on January 21, 1993.[1] Selling nine million copies worldwide, the game went on to become the third best selling SNES game of all time.[5] Super Mario Kart was re-released on the Wii's Virtual Console in Japan on June 9, 2009, North America on November 23, 2009, and in Europe on April 2, 2010.[2][3][4] Super Mario Kart was re-released again on the Wii U's Virtual Console in Japan on June 19, 2013, Europe on March 27, 2014, and in North America on August 6, 2014.In Super Mario Kart the player takes control of one of eight Mario series characters, each with differing capabilities.[6] In single player mode players can race against computer controlled characters in multi-race cups over three difficulty levels. During the races, offensive and speed boosting power-ups can be used to gain an advantage. Alternatively players can race against the clock in a Time Trial mode.[7] In multi-player mode two players can simultaneously take part in the cups or can race against each other one-on-one in Match Race mode.[8] In a third multiplayer mode – Battle Mode – the aim is to defeat the other players by attacking them with power-ups, destroying balloons which surround each kart.[7][9]Super Mario Kart received positive reviews and has been praised for its presentation, innovation and use of Mode 7 graphics.[10][11] It has been ranked among the best games of all time by several organizations including Edge, IGN, The Age and GameSpot, while Guinness World Records has named it as the top console game ever.[5][12][13][14][15] It is often credited with creating the kart-racing sub genre of video games, leading other developers to try to duplicate its success. The game is also seen as having been key to expanding the Mario series into non-platforming games. This diversity has led to it becoming the best-selling game franchise of all time.[14][16] Several sequels to Super Mario Kart have been released, for consoles, handhelds and in arcades, each enjoying critical and commercial success. While some elements have developed throughout the series, the core experience from Super Mario Kart has remained intact.[17]Super Mario Kart is a kart racing game featuring several single and multiplayer modes. During the game, players take control of one of eight Mario franchise characters and drive karts around tracks with a Mario franchise theme. In order for them to begin driving, Lakitu will come in with the traffic light hanging on a fishing pole, which starts the countdown. When the light turns green, the race or battle officially begins. During a race, the player's viewpoint is from behind his or her kart.[18][19] The goal of the game is to either finish a race ahead of other racers, who are controlled by the computer and other players, or complete a circuit in the fastest time.[7] There is also a battle mode in which the aim is to attack the karts of the other human players.[9]The game features advanced maneuvers such as power sliding and hopping. Power sliding allows a kart to maintain its speed while turning, although executing the maneuver for too long causes the kart to spin. Hopping helps a kart execute tighter turns: the kart makes a short hop and turns in the air, speeding off in the new direction when it lands.[20] Reviewers praised Super Mario Kart '​s gameplay, describing the battle mode as \"addictive\" and the single player gameplay as \"incredible\".[10][21] IGN stated that the gameplay mechanics defined the genre.[5]Super Mario Kart has two single-player modes, Mario Kart GP (which stands for Grand Prix.) and Time Trial. In Mario Kart GP, one player is required to race against seven computer-controlled characters in a series of five races which are called cups. Initially there are three cups available – the Mushroom Cup, Flower Cup and Star Cup – at two difficulty levels, 50cc and 100cc. By winning all three of the cups at the 100cc level, a fourth cup – the Special Cup – is unlocked.[10] Winning all four cups at 100cc unlocks a new difficulty level, 150cc.[22][23] Each cup consists of five five-lap races, each taking place on a distinct track.[19] In order to continue through a cup, a position of fourth or higher must be achieved in each race. If a player finishes in fifth to eighth position, they are \"ranked out\" and the race must be replayed – at the cost of one of a limited number of lives – until a placing of fourth or above is achieved. If the player has no lives when they rank out, the game is over.[19] Points are accrued by finishing in the top four positions in a race; first to fourth place receive nine, six, three and one points.[7] If a player finished in the same position three times in a row, then an extra life is awarded. The racer with the highest number of points after all five races have been completed wins the cup. In time trial mode, players race against the clock through the same tracks that are present in Mario Kart GP mode, attempting to set the fastest time possible.[7]Super Mario Kart also has three multiplayer modes; Mario Kart GP, Match Race and Battle Mode. The multiplayer modes support two players and the second player uses the bottom half of the screen which is used as a map in the single player modes. Mario Kart GP is the same as in single player, the only difference being that there are now two human controlled and six computer controlled drivers.[8] Match Race involves the two players going head to head on a track of their choice without any opponents.[8] In Battle Mode, the two players again go head to head, but this time in one of four dedicated Battle Mode courses.[8] Each player starts with three balloons around their kart which can be popped by power-ups fired by the other player. The first player to have all three of their balloons popped loses.[9]Super Mario Kart features eight playable characters from the Mario series – Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, Yoshi, Bowser, Donkey Kong Jr., Koopa Troopa and Toad.[10] Each character's kart has different capabilities with differing levels of top speed, acceleration and handling.[6][9] Mario, Luigi, Peach, Yoshi, Bowser and Toad returned in all of the subsequent Mario Kart games starting with Mario Kart 64. During races, computer-controlled characters have special items, or superpowers, which they are able to use.[19] These powers are specific to each character; for example, Yoshi drops eggs which cause players who hit them to lose coins and spin, while Donkey Kong Jr. throws bananas.[10]The characters are rendered as sprites portrayed from sixteen different angles.[7] The sprites were described as \"detailed\" by Nintendo Magazine System when the game was first reviewed and were thought to contribute to the \"spectacular\" graphics of the game as a whole.[10] More recently, Nintendojo called the sprites \"not-so-pretty\" when they are rendered at a distance, and IGN has commented on the dated look of the game.[7][20] Super Mario Kart was the first game to feature playable characters from the Mario series other than Mario or Luigi in a non-platforming game and the selection and different attributes of the characters is regarded as one of the game's strengths, IGN describing a well-balanced \"all-star cast\".[14][24] All of the characters present in Super Mario Kart have gone on to appear in all of the later games in the series, except for Koopa Troopa, who has only appeared intermittently after being replaced by Wario in Mario Kart 64.[25] Donkey Kong Jr. was replaced by Donkey Kong, who has appeared in every Mario Kart game since. This was Donkey Kong Jr.'s last appearance as a playable character, except for the Mario Tennis sub-series, including installments on the Nintendo 64 and Virtual Boy.The tracks in Super Mario Kart are based on locations in Super Mario World such as Donut Plains.[14] Each of the four cups contains five different tracks for a total of twenty unique tracks, additionally there are four unique Battle Mode courses.[6][9][26] The course outlines are marked out by impassable barriers and feature a variety of bends ranging from sharp hairpins to wide curves which players can power slide around.[20] Numerous obstacles themed from the Mario series appear, such as Thwomps in the Bowser's Castle tracks, the Cheep-Cheeps from Super Mario World in Koopa Beach and pipe barriers which are found in the Mario Circuit tracks.[6] Other features include off-road sections which slow down the karts such as the mud bogs in the Choco Island tracks.[6] Each single player track is littered with coins and power up tiles, as well as turbo tiles which give the karts a boost of speed and jumps which launch the karts into the air.[6]The tracks have received positive commentary with GameSpy describing them as wonderfully designed and IGN calling them perfect.[21][24] When naming its top five Mario Kart tracks of all time in 2008, 1UP.com named Battle Mode Course 4 at number three and Rainbow Road – along with its subsequent versions in the series – at number one.[27] The track themes in Super Mario Kart influenced later games in the series; recurring themes that first appeared in Super Mario Kart include haunted tracks, Bowser's castle and Rainbow Road.[25] Some of the tracks from Super Mario Kart have been duplicated in later games. All twenty of the original tracks are unlockable as an extra feature in the Game Boy Advance sequel Mario Kart: Super Circuit.[28] Remakes of Mario Circuit 1, Donut Plains 1, Koopa Beach 2 and Choco Island 2 appear as part of the Retro Grand Prix series in Mario Kart DS, remakes of Ghost Valley 2, Mario Circuit 3, and Battle Course 4 appear as part of the Retro Grand Prix and battles in Mario Kart Wii, remakes of Mario Circuit 2 and Rainbow Road appear as part of the Retro Grand Prix in Mario Kart 7, and remake of Donut Plains 3 appear as part of the Retro Grand Prix and battles in Mario Kart 8.[29][30][31][32]Super Mario Kart was produced by Shigeru Miyamoto and directed by Tadashi Sugiyama and Hideki Konno.[33] In an interview Miyamoto has said that the development team originally set out to produce a game capable of displaying two players on the same game screen simultaneously.[34] In the same interview Konno stated that development started with a desire to create a two player racing game in contrast to the single player gameplay of SNES launch title F-Zero.[34] The team found that due to limitations of the SNES hardware, the strong focus on multiplayer prevented the inclusions of tracks as elaborate as those found in F-Zero.[35] Computer and Video Games suggest that this initial emphasis on creating a two player experience is the reason for the game's horizontal split-screen during single player modes.[19]Notable in the development of Super Mario Kart was its use of Mode 7 graphics.[36] First seen in F-Zero, Mode 7 is a form of texture mapping available on the SNES which allows a plane to be rotated and scaled freely, achieving a pseudo-three-dimensional appearance.[11][36] 1UP.com have credited the use of Mode 7 with giving the game graphics which at the time of release were considered to be \"breathtaking\".[11] Retrospective reflection on the Mode 7 visuals has been mixed with IGN stating that the once revolutionary technology now looks \"crude and flickery\" while the Video Game Bible describes them as \"beautiful\" and adding to the game.[9][20] Super Mario Kart featured a DSP (Digital Signal Processor) chip; DSPs were used in SNES games as they provided a better handling of floating point calculations to assist with three-dimensional maths.[36] The DSP-1 chip that was used in Super Mario Kart went on to be the most popular DSP chip to be used in SNES games.[36] The music for the title was created by composer Soyo Oka.[37]Super Mario Kart received critical acclaim and proved to be a commercial success; it received a Player's Choice release after selling one million copies and eventually went on to sell nine million copies to become the third best selling game ever for the SNES.[42][43] Aggregate scoring sites GameRankings and MobyGames both give an average of more than 90 percent.[38][41] Critics praised the game's Mode 7 graphics; in 1992 Nintendo Magazine System described them as superb and the graphics have since been described as among the best ever seen on the SNES.[5][10] Another aspect of the game to have been praised is its gameplay, which Thunderbolt has described as the \"deepest [and] most addictive... to be found on the SNES console\".[39] Nintendo Magazine System showed a preference for the multiplayer modes of the game and stated that while the \"single player mode becomes dull quickly\" the \"two-player mode won't lose appeal\". Retrospective reviews of the game have been positive with perfect scores given by review sites including Thunderbolt and HonestGamers. The use of the style and characters from the Mario franchise was also praised as well as the individual characteristics of each racer.[8][39][44] Mean Machines describes the game as having \"struck gold\" in a way that no other – not even its sequels – has matched and GameSpot named the game as one of the greatest games of all time for its innovation, gameplay and visual style.[14][45]Since being released Super Mario Kart has been listed among the best games ever made several times. IGN ranked it as the 15th best game ever in 2005, describing it as \"the original karting masterpiece\" and as the 23rd best game ever in 2007, discussing its originality at time of release.[5][46] The Age placed it at number 19 on their list of the 50 best games in 2005 and in 2007 Edge ranked Super Mario Kart at number 14 on a list of their 100 best games, noting its continued influence on video game design.[12][13] The game is also included in Yahoo! Games UK's list of the hundred greatest games of all time which praises the appealing characters and power ups and 1UP.com's \"Essential 50\", a list of the fifty most important games ever made.[11][47] The game placed 13th in Official Nintendo Magazine's 100 greatest Nintendo games of all time.[48] Guinness World Records ranked it at number 1 on a list of the top 50 console games of all time based on initial impact and lasting legacy.[15]Super Mario Kart has been credited with inventing the \"kart racing\" sub-genre of video gaming and soon after its release several other developers attempted to duplicate its success.[14][21][49][50] In 1994, less than two years after the release of Super Mario Kart, Sega released Sonic Drift; a kart racing game featuring characters from the Sonic the Hedgehog series.[11] Also in 1994 Ubisoft released Street Racer, a kart racing game for the SNES and Mega Drive/Genesis which included a four player mode not present in Super Mario Kart.[11] Apogee Software released Wacky Wheels for PC. Future games that followed in the mould of Super Mario Kart include South Park Rally, Konami Krazy Racers, Diddy Kong Racing, Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing and several racing games in the Crash Bandicoot series.[11][51] Response to the karting games released since Super Mario Kart has been mixed, with GameSpot describing them as tending to be bad while 1UP.com notes that countless developers have tried to improve upon the Mario Kart formula without success.[11][52]Super Mario Kart is also credited as being the first non-platforming game to feature multiple playable characters from the Mario franchise.[14] As well as several sequels Nintendo has released numerous other sporting and non-sporting Mario spin-offs since Super Mario Kart; a trend in part accredited to the commercial and critical success of the game.[52] The Mario characters have appeared in many sports games including those relating to basketball, baseball, golf, tennis and soccer.[52] Non-sporting franchises using the Mario characters have also been created, including the Super Smash Bros. series of fighting games and the Mario Party series of board game based, party games. Mario series characters have also made cameos in games from other series such as SSX on Tour and NBA Street V3, both published by EA Sports.[52] The genre spanning nature of the Mario series that was sparked off by the success of Super Mario Kart has been described as key to the success and longevity of the franchise; keeping fans interested despite the infrequency of traditional Mario platforming games.[11] Following this model the Mario series has gone on to become the best selling video game franchise of all time with 193 million units sold as of January 2007, almost 40 million units ahead of second ranked franchise (Pokémon, also by Nintendo).[16]Super Mario Kart was re-released on the Japanese Virtual Console on June 9, 2009, and later in North America on November 23, 2009.[2] Previously, when naming it as one of the most wanted games for the platform in November 2008, Eurogamer stated that problems emulating the Mode 7 graphics were responsible for its absence.[53]Super Mario 3D World has a stage with a look based on the Mario Circuit racetracks from Super Mario Kart. A remixed version of the music can also be heard.Several sequels to Super Mario Kart have been brought out for successive generations of Nintendo consoles, each receiving commercial success and critical acclaim.[55] The first of these, Mario Kart 64 was released in 1996 for the Nintendo 64 and was the first Mario Kart game to feature fully 3D graphics.[56] Although reviewers including IGN and GameSpot felt that the single player gameplay was lacking compared to its predecessor, the simultaneous four-person multiplayer modes – a first for the Nintendo 64 – were praised.[20][56] The second sequel, Mario Kart: Super Circuit, was released for the Game Boy Advance in 2001. It was described by GameSpot as more of a remake of Super Mario Kart than a sequel to Mario Kart 64 and featured a return to the graphical style of the original.[28][51] As well as featuring all new tracks, players are able to unlock the original SNES tracks if certain achievements are completed.[28] Mario Kart: Double Dash‼ was released for the Nintendo GameCube in 2003. Unlike any other Mario Kart game before or since, it features two riders in each kart, allowing for a new form of cooperative multiplayer where one player controls the kart's movement and the other fires weapons.[57] Mario Kart DS, released for the Nintendo DS in 2005, was the first Mario Kart game to include online play via the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection.[20] It went on to become the best selling hand-held racing game of all time, selling 7.83 million units.[58] The game also marks the debut of tracks appearing in previous games. Mario Kart Wii was released for the Wii in 2008 and incorporates motion controls and 12-player racing. Like Mario Kart DS, it includes on-line play; it also allows racers to play as user-created Miis (after unlocking the Mii character)[59] as well as Mario series characters and comes packaged with the Wii Wheel peripheral, which can act as the game's primary control mechanism when coupled with a Wii Remote.[49][60] Mario Kart Wii went on to be the worldwide best-selling game of 2008 ahead of another Nintendo game – Wii Fit – and the critically acclaimed Grand Theft Auto IV.[61][62] Mario Kart 7 for the Nintendo 3DS was released in 2011, which features racing on land, sea, and air. Also in Mario Kart 7 is the ability to customize your kart and to race in first-person mode. Three Mario Kart arcade games have also been released, Mario Kart Arcade GP in 2005, Mario Kart Arcade GP 2 in 2007, and Mario Kart Arcade GP DX in 2013. All of them were developed jointly by Nintendo and Namco and feature classic Namco characters including Pac-Man and Blinky.[63] The most recent entry in the series is Mario Kart 8 for the Wii U, which was released at the end of May 2014, which brings back gliders and propellers from Mario Kart 7 as well as 12-player racing in Mario Kart Wii. Mario Kart 8 also includes a new feature called Mario Kart TV, where players can watch highlights of previous races and uploading them to YouTube. Another new feature is anti-gravity racing, where players can race on walls and ceilings.As the series has progressed, many aspects included in Super Mario Kart have been developed and altered. The power up boxes which are flat against the track in Super Mario Kart due to the technical limitations of the SNES became floating boxes in later games.[19] The roster of racers has expanded in recent games to include a greater selection of Nintendo characters including some which had not been created at the time of Super Mario Kart's release – such as Petey Piranha from Super Mario Sunshine who appeared in Mario Kart: Double Dash!!. Multiplayer has remained a key feature of the series and has expanded from the two-player modes available in Super Mario Kart; first to allow up to four simultaneous players in Mario Kart 64 and eventually up to twelve simultaneous online players in Mario Kart Wii.[56][60] Many of the track themes have been retained throughout the series, including Rainbow Road – the final track of the Special Cup – which has appeared in every Mario Kart console game.[25][27] Other features present in Super Mario Kart have disappeared from the series. These include the \"super-powers\" of the computer characters, the feather power up which allows players to jump high into the air and having a restricted number of lives.[19] The only other Mario Kart games to feature the coin collecting of the original are Mario Kart: Super Circuit, Mario Kart 7, and Mario Kart 8.[19][citation needed] The aspects of style and gameplay from Super Mario Kart that have been retained throughout the series have led Nintendo to face criticism for a lack of originality but the franchise is still considered to be a beloved household name by many, known for its familiar core gameplay.[5][17][49][57] GameXplain rated Super Mario Kart 9.5 out of 10.[46][49][53]","title":"Super Mario Kart","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/38/Supermariokart_box.JPG/250px-Supermariokart_box.JPG","developer":"Nintendo EAD","genre":"Racing"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_RPG:_Legend_of_the_Seven_Stars","description":"Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars is one of only seven SNES games released outside Japan to use the Nintendo SA-1 chip. Compared with standard SNES games, the additional microprocessor allows higher clock speeds; faster access to the random-access memory (RAM); greater memory mapping capabilities, data storage, and compression; new direct memory access (DMA) modes, such as bitmap to bit plane transfer; and built-in CIC lockout for piracy protection and regional marketing control.[20]Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars received very positive reviews and has appeared on reader-selected \"best game of all-time\" lists, such as 26th on GameFAQs[27] and 30th at IGN.[28] Japanese audiences received Super Mario RPG well with 1.47 million copies sold, making it the third highest-selling game in Japan in 1996.[29]Though various aspects of Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars have received mixed reviews, the game garnered praise for the quality of the graphics and for the humor in particular. Nintendo Power '​s review commented that the \"excellent\" 3D graphics helped the game appeal to a much wider audience than most traditional RPGs. In March 1997, Nintendo Power nominated the game for several awards, including \"Best Graphics\", in a player's choice contest,[30] though Super Mario 64 won \"Best Graphics\".[31] 1UP.com praised the graphics, stating that they are \"the best seen on the Super NES\".[32] Electronic Gaming Monthly stated that the graphic element is \"strong enough to resemble a Mario title but still retains the role-playing theme at the same time\",[33] and commented that the graphics are \"typical of Nintendo, using clean and colorful graphics along with nice animation\".[34] RPGamer editor Derek Cavin called the backgrounds \"beautiful\" and stated that they \"perfectly bring the Mushroom Kingdom and surrounding areas into 3D\".[26] Skyler Miller from Allgame stated that the graphics are \"absolutely outstanding, with colorful, 3D rendered visuals that once seemed impossible on the Super NES. This is definitely the high watermark for 3D graphics on any 16-bit system\". The editor also called the music \"quite extraordinary\" and that the songs \"match the mood of the surrounding environment\".[25] In the Virtual Console re-release, IGN's Lucas Thomas's review of Super Mario RPG stated that the game's experience \"completes itself with a compelling story, a humorous attitude and a variety of interspersed mini-games that break up the adventuring action\". The publication also stated that the soundtrack is \"spectacular and a joy to listen to\" and the graphics \"took full advantage of the system's 16-bit technology and looks great\".[2]","title":"Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/89/SuperMarioRPGSNESCoverArtUS.jpg/300px-SuperMarioRPGSNESCoverArtUS.jpg","developer":"Square","genre":"Action role-playing game"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_World","description":"Super Mario World (スーパーマリオワールド, Sūpā Mario Wārudo?), subtitled Super Mario Bros. 4 (スーパーマリオブラザーズ4, Sūpā Mario Burazāzu fō?) for its original Japanese release,[1] is a 1990 platform video game developed and published by Nintendo as a pack-in launch title for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) and is the fifth game in the Super Mario series. Development was handled by Nintendo Entertainment Analysis and Development, led by Shigeru Miyamoto, who directed the game along with Takashi Tezuka.The game centers on the quest of Mario and Luigi to save Dinosaur Land from Bowser, the series' antagonist. The two brothers must travel across seven worlds to restore order to Dinosaur Land. It built on the gameplay of previous Mario games by introducing new power-ups that augment character abilities, and established conventions that were carried over to future games in the series. Super Mario World marks the first appearance of Yoshi, Mario's dinosaur sidekick and riding mount.Super Mario World was an overwhelming critical and commercial success, selling over 20 million copies worldwide, and is considered by many to be one of the best games ever made. It has been re-released four times, first as part of a combo with Super Mario All-Stars on the SNES in 1994. Secondly, it was released on the Game Boy Advance as Super Mario Advance 2 (スーパーマリオアドバンス2, Sūpā Mario Adobansu Tsū?) in 2001 and outside of Japan as Super Mario World: Super Mario Advance 2 in 2002 with modified gameplay. The third re-release was for the Wii's Virtual Console in Japan in 2006 and in North America and PAL regions in 2007; there were no changes from the original SNES version. It was also released for the Wii U's Virtual Console which integrated Off-TV Play and Miiverse features to the game.Super Mario World is a two-dimensional platform game in which the player controls the on-screen protagonist (either Mario or Luigi) from a third-person perspective. The game shares similar gameplay mechanics with previous titles in the series—Super Mario Bros., Super Mario Bros. 2, and Super Mario Bros. 3—but introduces several new elements. In addition to the running and jumping moves found in past games, the player can float with the aid of special items and execute new types of jumps such as the spin jump.[4]Super Mario World includes a multiplayer option which allows two players to play the game by alternating turns at navigating the overworld map and accessing stage levels; the first player controls Mario, while the other controls Luigi. Although Mario and Luigi must generally navigate through seven worlds to reach the end of the game, the player can beat the game much faster by using the Star Road routes. In addition, there are a number of levels that have hidden exits, and as a result there exist several ways for Mario to navigate to Bowser's castle. Furthermore, the exploration of these secret stages lead to stages which while not necessary to the main plot, provide the gamer with more playing experience, such as Special World. Completion of Special World permanently alters some sprites and the overworld map's colour scheme.[citation needed]Miyamoto stated that he had wanted Mario to have a dinosaur companion ever since Super Mario Bros.; however, Nintendo engineers could not fit the companion into the limitations of the Nintendo Entertainment System. He said that \"we were finally able to get Yoshi off the drawing boards with the SNES\".[5] Yoshi came in one size and four colours, with different powers and huge appetites.[5] Super Mario World arrived in 1991 alongside the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in North America.[5]After the success of Super Mario World, the game was packaged in a special version of Super Mario All-Stars titled Super Mario All-Stars + Super Mario World, which was released in 1994 in the United States and in Europe as the pack-in game for the SNES \"Super Mario Set\" bundle.[6] In this version, Luigi has his own sprite (in the original, Luigi's sprite was simply a palette swap of the Mario sprite), while the rest remained the same. In 1995, two companies known as Hummer Team and JY Company ported the Super Famicom version of Super Mario World to the Famicom in China with no license. Super Mario World was one of the first games to be announced for the Wii's Virtual Console. It was released in Japan on December 2, 2006, in the United States on February 5, 2007, and in the Europe on February 9, 2007.[7] A short timed demo of the game is one of the unlockable \"Masterpieces\" in the 2008 Wii game Super Smash Bros. Brawl. It was also released for the Wii U in North America and Japan on April 26, 2013 and in Europe on April 27, 2013 along with the full launch of the Virtual Console for that console.Between 2001 and 2002, Super Mario World was ported by Nintendo Entertainment Analysis and Development to the Game Boy Advance as Super Mario World: Super Mario Advance 2.[8][9] Some levels were minimally changed, but the most noticeable alteration was making the game for one player only instead of two. However, Luigi was still usable, but this time as an alternate character; he could jump higher than Mario, but he ran slightly slower. Mario or Luigi could be selected by pressing the GBA shoulder buttons on the map screen. They were also given voices, which were done by Charles Martinet. Luigi's sprites were changed once again with his appearance closer to the original Super Mario Advance game, which was based on Super Mario Bros. 2.[10]Koji Kondo composed the music used in Super Mario World, using only an electronic keyboard. The entirety of the music heard in the game, with the exception of the music played in the title screen, credits, maps, castles and fortresses, and fighting Bowser, is a variation on the same melody. The melody is played normally on the standard overworld levels. It is slowed down and made to echo in caverns, whereas it moves in a slow, wave-like fashion (in 3/4 or waltz time) in underwater levels; in the athletic theme, it is played quickly and energetically to suit the more risky and lively nature of a level taking place in the air. The castle theme is a symphonic variation of the melody in F minor, then C minor, giving the song an overall ominous tone. The Super Mario Bros. theme can be heard in the Special Zone if the player leaves the overworld screen open for a few minutes. When riding on Yoshi, the soundtrack of any level is accompanied by bongo drums,[11] a sound design element that was carried over into Super Mario Sunshine, as well as New Super Mario Bros. Wii and Super Mario Galaxy 2 some 18 years later.[citation needed]Super Mario World was met with widespread critical acclaim upon release. The game has continued to receive highly favorable reviews for many years. It is ranked as the seventeenth-highest rated videogame of all time on GameRankings, where the game received very positive scores, with a 94.44% average score.[13][15] Allgame gave the game five stars out of five, praising the graphics, sound, and replay value.[4] It was ranked as the eighth best game for a Nintendo console in Nintendo Power '​s \"Top 200 Games\" list.[16] Official Nintendo Magazine ranked the game seventh in its \"100 greatest Nintendo games of all time\".[17] Famitsu readers ranked it 61st in the magazine's list of the top 100 video games.[18] In 2009, a poll conducted by British film magazine Empire voted it \"the greatest game of all time.\"[19] In the Virtual Console review of the game, IGN said that the game should be downloaded by people who did not own the Game Boy Advance version of the game and gave it an 8.5 out of 10, a Great score.[14] Super Mario World won Nintendo Power's game of the year award for 1991. The game has also appeared on several \"best video games of all time\" lists such as those from Edge Magazine and Retrogamer. GameSpot consider the game to be one of the greatest games of all time.[20] Game Informer reviewed this game with a 10/10 in a classic review. In its final issue, Nintendo Power named Super Mario World the fifth greatest game of all time.Super Mario World has sold over 20 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling video games of all time.[21] As a pack-in title for the SNES, Super Mario World helped popularize the console,[4] which has sold 49.10 million units worldwide, including 23.35 million in the Americas and 17.17 million in Japan.[22] In a poll conducted in 2008, Yoshi was voted as the third-favorite video game character in Japan, with Cloud Strife and Mario placing second and first, respectively.[23]The Yoshi character became one of the most important characters in the Mario franchise, re-appearing in later Super Mario games and in nearly all Mario sports and spin-off games. Yoshi appeared as the main playable character in Super Mario World '​s 1995 sequel Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island, which helped lead to multiple video games focused on the character. A Super Mario World clone, entitled Super Mario's Wacky Worlds, was in development for the Philips CD-i device by NovaLogic from 1992 to 1993, but was cancelled due to the commercial failure of the device.[24]DIC Entertainment produced a Super Mario World animated series based on the game, which consisted of thirteen episodes and ran on NBC from September to December 1991.","title":"Super Mario World","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/32/Super_Mario_World_Coverart.png/250px-Super_Mario_World_Coverart.png","developer":"Nintendo EAD","genre":"Platforming"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_World_2:_Yoshi%27s_Island","description":"","title":"Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/6e/Yisland_box.jpg/250px-Yisland_box.jpg","developer":"Nintendo EAD","genre":"Platforming"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Metroid","description":"Super Metroid (スーパーメトロイド, Sūpā Metoroido?) is an action-adventure sci-fi video game and the third game in the Metroid series; the introduction alternatively refers to the game as Metroid 3. It was designed by Nintendo Research & Development 1, programmed by Intelligent Systems, and published by Nintendo for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System video game console. The game was released in Japan on March 19, 1994, in North America on April 18, 1994, and in Europe and Australia on July 28, 1994. It became available as a Virtual Console title for the Wii console in 2007, and for the Wii U in 2013.Super Metroid was directed and written by Yoshio Sakamoto, and produced by Makoto Kano with Gunpei Yokoi serving as general manager. The game's story follows bounty hunter Samus Aran as she attempts to retrieve a stolen Metroid from the Space Pirates.Due to its detailed and colorful graphics, cinematic elements and progressive, distinctive gameplay the game received universal acclaim, being considered today as one of the greatest video games of all time and earning an aggregated score of 96 percent from Game Rankings, making it the website's ninth highest-rated game. Electronic Gaming Monthly named it the Game of the Month for May 1994, gave it an Editor's Choice Award, awarded it as the Best Action Game of 1994, and named it the Best Game of All Time in 2003. In 2007, IGN ranked Super Metroid seventh in its list of Top 100 Games of All Time. Despite a highly positive critical reaction, the game sold poorly in Japan, but fared better in North America and Europe. Nevertheless, due to the game's critical success, Nintendo placed it on their Player's Choice marketing label.Super Metroid is an action-platform game[3] which primarily takes place on the fictional planet Zebes, which is a large, open-ended world with areas connected by doors and elevators.[4] The player controls Samus Aran as she searches the planet for a Metroid that was stolen by Ridley, the leader of the Space Pirates.[5] Along the way, the player collects power-ups that enhance Samus' armor and weaponry, as well as grant her special abilities such as the Space Jump, which allows her to jump infinite times to cover great distances. These abilities allow Samus to access areas that were previously inaccessible.[6]The game introduces several new concepts to the series. Among them are the ability to enable and disable weapons and abilities in an inventory screen,[7] and a Moon Walk ability, named after the popular dance move of the same name, which allows Samus to walk backwards while firing or charging her weapon.[8] The game also features the ability to combine Samus' weapon beams.[9] In addition, the save system from Metroid II: Return of Samus returns in Super Metroid, which allows the player to save and restart the game at any of the save points scattered around the planet, instead of the original title's complex and reverse engineerable password system.[10] The player can also save the game at Samus' gunship, which fully recharges her health and ammunition as well.[11]Chronologically, Super Metroid takes place immediately after the events of Metroid II: Return of Samus, and begins with a narrative by bounty hunter Samus Aran. Samus describes how a Metroid larva hatched from an egg and immediately imprinted upon her, believing her to be its mother. She brought the larva to Ceres Space Colony, where scientists learned that they could harness its power. Just after she left the colony, she received a distress call and returned to find the scientists dead and the larva stolen. The game begins as she follows the leader of the Space Pirates, Ridley, to the planet Zebes, where she searches for the stolen larva in a network of caves.[5][12]Super Metroid was developed by Nintendo R&D1[13] with a staff of 15 people managed by Gunpei Yokoi. The game was directed and written by Yoshio Sakamoto, and produced by Makoto Kano, with music composed by Kenji Yamamoto and Minako Hamano.[1][14][15][16] The game, which was released almost a decade after the original Metroid game, took half a year to gain approval for the initial idea, and actual development of the game took two more years to complete. When asked why the game took so long to make, Sakamoto responded, \"We wanted to wait until a true action game was needed. [...] And also to set the stage for the reappearance of Samus Aran.\" The music uses 16-bit versions of music from previous games, and previously visited areas reappear. Previously seen areas were added to Super Metroid to add a sense of familiarity that would satisfy players of previous Metroid games.[14]The developers' primary goal was to make the game a \"good action game\". They wanted the game to have a large map, but found it difficult to organize the amount of graphic data involved. Coming up with several ideas, the developers decided to break the game up into many mini-adventures. New weapons are introduced to the Metroid series in Super Metroid, including the Grapple Beam, used to latch a laser beam onto the ceiling. The game is the first in the series to let Samus fire in all directions while moving,[14] and it is among the first open world games to offer the player a mapping facility. The feature shows the outlines of rooms, locations of important rooms, and dots for special items.[13] Shortly before the game's release, the Entertainment Software Rating Board, a self-regulating organization, was formed in response to the increasing violence found in games such as 1992's Mortal Kombat.[17] When asked whether he thought that recent game violence controversy would cause any negative backlash for Super Metroid, Sakamoto stated, \"We don't think there's too much violence in the game.\" Using Samus as an example, he explained that her purpose is to maintain peace in the galaxy, claiming, \"It's not violence for the sake of violence.\"[14]Super Metroid was released by Nintendo in Japan on March 19, 1994, in North America on April 18, 1994, and in Europe on July 28, 1994.[19] It became available for download over the Nintendo Power flash memory cartridge in Japan on September 30, 1997.[19] It was later released as a Virtual Console title for the Wii in North America on August 20, 2007, in Japan on September 20, 2007, and in Europe on October 12, 2007.[19] In Super Smash Bros. Brawl, Super Metroid is also one of the trial games available in the \"Masterpieces\" section, which uses Virtual Console technology to emulate older hardware and have time constraints.[20] Super Metroid was released for a Wii U's Virtual Console on May 15, 2013.[21] It was available during the Wii U Virtual Console trial campaign for a cheaper price, and it was reverted to its regular price on June 13, 2013.[2] Users who own the Wii Virtual Console version of the game will be able to get the Wii U Virtual Console version for a reduced price.[22]Super Metroid also had an unofficial romhack made for it by drewseph, called Super Metroid: Redesign,[23] which was acclaimed by PCMag.[24]Super Metroid was met with widespread critical acclaim, receiving an aggregated score of 95.50% percent from Game Rankings, making it the website's 7th highest-rated game.[3] When the game launched in Japan, GamesRadar's Andy Robinson noted that it was released \"at the wrong place, at the wrong time\". Struggling against more commercially popular games, such as Donkey Kong Country in 1994, along with the launch of the PlayStation and Sega Saturn video game consoles, Super Metroid sold poorly in Japan.[15] With the help of strong marketing from Nintendo, Super Metroid sold better in North America and Europe,[15] and a year after its release, Nintendo placed it on their Player's Choice marketing label due to its critical success.[31] However, since none of the games in the Metroid series up to this point had enjoyed the level of success that the Mario and The Legend of Zelda franchises had, Nintendo did not make another Metroid game until eight years later, with the release of Metroid Prime (GameCube) and Metroid Fusion (Game Boy Advance) in 2002.[15]Chris Slate of the Game Players video game magazine thoroughly enjoyed Super Metroid, claiming that it \"easily lives up to everyone's high expectations\". He was satisfied with how Nintendo mixed complex gameplay with \"state-of-the-art\" graphics and sound. Slate found the newly added auto-mapping feature something that players really needed, saying that it was the only feature in Super Metroid that the original Metroid should have had. Concluding his review, Slate stated, \"Action fans can't afford to miss Super Metroid. [...] You'll want to play through again and again even after you've beaten it.\"[29] Nintendo Power mentioned that the game \"may well be the best action adventure game ever\", calling it the \"wave of the future\". They praised the game's graphics, sound, and controls, while their only negative comment was, \"Even 100 megabits of Metroid wouldn't be enough.\"[28] Electronic Gaming Monthly gave Super Metroid their \"Game of the Month\" award, comparing it favorably to the original Metroid and applauding the graphics, the many weapons and items available, and the music.[25] GamePro criticized that the controls are often awkward or difficult and that many of the power-ups are either lifted from other SNES games or simple upgrades of other power-ups in the game, but praised the game's massive size along with the auto-mapping feature, saying it \"makes a potentially frustrating game accessible to a far wider audience.\"[32] GamesRadar was pleased with the game's \"phenomenal\" soundtrack, complimenting it as \"one of the best videogame scores of all time\".[15]The former British video game publication Super Play, which had three editors review the game, also enjoyed it. The magazine's Zy Nicholson noted that the game was better than his favorite game, Mega Man X, describing Super Metroid as \"more of an experience than a game\". Comparing the game to the 1986 film Aliens, Nicholson felt that the game was best experienced when played in the dark with the volume turned up. He found the game so compulsive that he was tempted to play \"without eating or sleeping\". The publication's Tony Mott named the game's atmosphere its best aspect, calling the game a mix of Turrican (1990), Aliens, Exile (1989), and Nodes of Yesod (1985). Appreciating the game's controls, Mott applauded Nintendo's ability to create a refined gameplay. He concluded his review by calling Super Metroid \"undoubtedly the best game I've played this year so far\", predicting that anyone who plays the game would be \"playing a game destined for classic status\". The third reviewer, James Leach, agreed with Nicholson and Mott that Super Metroid was what Mega Man X should have been. Concluding his review, Leach wrote that Super Metroid contained everything he looked for in a video game: \"playability, hidden tricks, powerful weapons and steamingly evil baddies\". After summarizing the reviews, the magazine's verdict was, \"We all love this game. Super Metroid is absolutely marvelous and you should own it.\"[30]IGN called Super Metroid '​s Virtual Console version a \"must-own\", commenting that although the game was released nine months after the Wii launched, they felt that it was worth the wait. For players who have never played Super Metroid, IGN claims that they owe themselves as gamers to \"finally find out about what you've been missing all these years\".[27] In his review for GameSpot, Frank Provo found it \"absolutely astonishing that Nintendo let 13 years go by before making Super Metroid readily available again\", but considered the most important thing was that players \"can now play this masterpiece without having to track down the original Super Nintendo Entertainment System cartridge or fumble with legally questionable emulators\". Despite admitting that the Virtual Console version was essentially \"nothing more than a no-frills, emulated version of a 13-year-old SNES game\" that was no longer cutting-edge, he was still pleased with it and reiterated his belief that Super Metroid is \"one of the best 2D action adventure games ever produced\".[26]Super Metroid has had a lasting effect on the video game industry. Starting with 1997's Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, the Castlevania series of video games borrows the backtracking and weapon upgrading elements from Super Metroid, leading to the term \"Metroidvania\".[33] Because Super Metroid gave players awards based on how long it took them to complete the game, it has become a popular choice for speedruns, a style of play in which the player intends to complete the game as quickly as possible for the purpose of competition.[34]Super Metroid received several awards and honors. Electronic Gaming Monthly named it Game of the Month for May 1994, gave it an Editors' Choice award,[25] awarded it as the Best Action Game of 1994,[35] and named it the Best Game of All Time in 2003.[36] In IGN's yearly Top 100 Games of All Time lists, Super Metroid was ranked 3rd (2003),[37] 10th (2005),[38] 4th (2006),[39] and 7th (2007).[40] GamePro listed Super Metroid as one of the 15 Retro Games for the Wii You Must Play.[41] Super Metroid was placed 1st on GamesRadar's list of the Best Super Nintendo Games of All Time, beating out Chrono Trigger (2nd) and The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past (3rd).[42] Super Metroid was also named the best Super Nintendo game of all time by ScrewAttack, beating out The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past (2nd) and Final Fantasy VI (3rd).[43] Classic Game Room's CGR Undertow series named Super Metroid the best Super NES game of all time as well, beating out The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past (2nd) and Super Mario World (3rd).[44] Nintendo Power named Super Metroid the best game in the Metroid series, beating out Metroid Prime (2nd) and Metroid: Zero Mission (3rd).[45]","title":"Super Metroid","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e4/Smetroidbox.jpg/250px-Smetroidbox.jpg","developer":"Nintendo R&D1","genre":"Action-adventure"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Morph","description":"Super Morph is a Super Nintendo Entertainment System puzzle video game released by Millennium Entertainment.

It was released on September 14, 1994 in North America and again in the same region in 1996. It was released in Europe on January 26, 1995 for the same console and in Japan in 1998 for the Nintendo Power flash RAM cartridge series and the Super Famicom. The game was released for the Wii's Virtual Console in Europe on March 20, 2009, in North America on March 30, 2009, and in Japan on July 7, 2009. It is the fourth game in the Punch-Out!! series, taking place after the Punch-Out!! game for the NES/Famicom (NES/FC).In Super Punch-Out!! the player controls Little Mac, as he fights his way to become the World Video Boxing Association champion. Players, fighting from a \"behind the back\" perspective, must knockout their opponent in three minutes to win. Players can launch jabs, hooks, and uppercuts against their opponents as well as block, dodge, and duck opponents' attacks. Nintendo Integrated Research and Development, led by Genyo Takeda, Minoru Arakawa and Makoto Wada, developed the game. It also featured voice acting by Charles Martinet.[not in citation given]The gameplay in Super Punch-Out!! is similar to that of its arcade and NES/FC predecessors. The player controls the character Little Mac as he fights his way to become W.V.B.A. Champion.[2][3][4] The player controls Little Mac from a third-person perspective, with Mac being translucent on the screen.[5] Players can attack their opponents with jabs to the face or with body blows from either hand.[6] The opponent can deflect punches, so players must aim at the opponent's open spot (where the gloves are not) to connect. Depending on the opponents' stances, they will guard themselves differently, so players need to use the correct punches.[7]Super Punch-Out!! was released in North America October 1994 and in Europe on January 26, 1995 (1995-01-26). It was rereleased in North America in 1996, and it was released in Japan as part of the Nintendo Power flash RAM cartridge series on March 1, 1998.[12][13] In addition, Electronic Arts included the game as an unlockable bonus item along with its protagonist as an unlockable boxer in the Nintendo GameCube version of Fight Night Round 2 as part of Nintendo's deal of featuring Nintendo characters in the Nintendo GameCube versions of some EA Sports titles.[14] The game was later released for the Wii's Virtual Console service in Europe and Australia on March 20, 2009 (2009-03-20), in North America on March 30, 2009 (2009-03-30)[15] and in Japan on March 30, 2009 (2009-03-30).[16] Super Punch-Out!! is the fourth game in the Punch-Out!! series and was developed by Nintendo Integrated Research and Development and was produced by Minoru Arakawa, Genyo Takeda and Makoto Wada.[1][17] Voice actor Charles Martinet was credited for providing the voices of the boxers, the referee and the announcer.[1][not in citation given] Nintendo IRD was developing this game simultaneously with Zoda's Revenge: StarTropics II.[18] The game is the closest arcade-to-home console translation of the Punch-Out!! and Super Punch-Out!! arcades; however, like the NES titles, the SNES title is not a direct port. Shortly before the game was finished and released, some screenshots and video footage of the prototype were shown in a video preview of the game, as well as in an issue of Nintendo Power magazine[19][20] and two official television commercials, which all showed the protagonist of the game with a different look as well as the announcer having a different voice compared to the ones in the final version seen in the finished and released version.[21][22]Super Punch-Out!! received coverage in GamePro magazine, where it received mostly positive reviews. The reviewer appreciated the game's good controls and challenge, which he describes as \"deceptive\". Though its graphics were simplistic, he said that they were \"knockouts just the same\". He also gave praise to the game's sprite layouts and animations and its sounds; he said that \"crowd noises and the whack of landed blows juice the game's intensity level\". The only criticism noted was its two-player mode; he notes that \"two players can take turns fighting by saving their individual records. However, they each have to reset the game and access their records to do so.\" As a bonus, the coverage included reviews by Fred Doughty and Mark Guinane, winners of the 1994 Blockbuster Video World Game Championship. Guinane praised the game's easy-to-learn controls and graphics but criticized its sound for not being exciting enough. Doughty, who reminisced playing the arcade version of Punch-Out!!, said that Super Punch-Out!! was not very difficult at the beginning, but the challenge level rose as the player progressed. Like Guinane, he praised its controls and its artistic design of the characters.[26]Several reviewers praised Super Punch-Out!! overall for not trying to be realistic, for the originality of its different opponents, and for its simple controls. Chris Scullion from Official Nintendo Magazine praises the game for its outlandish characters, addictive gameplay, and simple controls. He adds that Super Punch-Out!! is \"superb way to prepare for the upcoming Wii [Punch-Out!!] title\". Scullion states that \"the thing that makes Super Punch-Out!! interesting (along with the rest of the games in the series) is that it's not a realistic boxing game\". He adds that the opponents in the game are \"the real stars of the show\", with each opponent having a unique personality, traits, and boxing styles.[2] Skyler Miller from Allgame, like Scullion, praised the game for its simple, responsive controls, for its colorful, detailed opponents, and for its usage of the Super NES's transparent color palette for the fighter, which facilitates the \"behind the back\" perspective. He also appreciates the game's sound and music, in particular the usage of real voice for the announcer.[31] Game Players magazine applauded the game's \"large, colorful graphics and easy-to-learn controls\".[30]Reviewers have praised Super Punch-Out!! for its other unique features and for its rewarding difficulty. Game Informer magazine praised the game for its time attack mode, which recorded and kept track of the fastest knockouts for each opponent. Miller also commended the time attack mode, adding to the game's replay value. Another review from VideoGames & Computer Entertainment magazine lauded the game for a fair difficulty curve, stating that it \"is a really tough game, but it's one in which repeated playing (and you will be playing it a lot) really pays off\".[29] Lucas Thomas from IGN, while praising the game overall, says that the game lacks the overall appeal that the NES version had and that he recommends the NES version over this version. He notes that the sound is \"Not as memorable as the music from the NES game, but [is] more varied\". He says that many people who are familiar with the NES version have to relearn new attack patterns from different opponents. Thomas also notes that the game did not have as large an audience as the NES version enjoyed.[6]","title":"Super Punch-Out!!","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/40/Superpunchoutbox.jpg","developer":"Nintendo IRD","genre":"Sports"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Putty","description":"Putty is a game developed by System 3 and released in 1992 for the Amiga. It was also released on the SNES in 1993, under the name Super Putty in North America and Europe and as Putty Moon (パティームーン?) in Japan. A release on the Commodore Amiga CD32 was made in 1994, also under the name Super Putty. Despite the extra buttons present on the CD32's controller, the CD32 version made no use of them.Putty Moon, the place where all the putties live, has been taken over by an evil wizard named Dazzledaze. Putty has been banished from the moon to the planet below. To return to Putty Moon and oust the evil wizard, Putty enlists the help of some robots (\"bots\") to build a skyscraper that will reach up to Putty Moon.In Putty, the player controls a blue blob with eyes. Putty has many moves that he could use to attack enemies or to navigate around the level. These abilities include being able to stretch out upwards, downwards, left and right to access far-off ledges. He also has the ability to inflate. This allows him to provide a cushioned landing for any falling bots. Over-inflation also acts as a \"smart bomb\", with Putty bursting, killing all of the enemies on the screen, whilst reducing his health in the process.Putty is able to form part of himself into a fist, allowing him to punch left or right to dispatch enemies.Putty is also able to melt into the floor, making him invulnerable and also allowing him to absorb enemies, recovering a small amount of health in the process. With certain enemies in the game, such as the clockwork orange, once Putty has absorbed one he is then able to morph into the enemy's shape to use its abilities.A final ability of Putty's is being able to create a mug of coffee from part of himself, which will distract bots and make them stand still.The levels in Putty are laid out vertically, with the screen scrolling up and down. The levels contain regular platforms, as well as \"solid\" ledges that Putty can not move through, and other special tiles including electric platforms and bounce pads.The aim of each level is to rescue a set number of bots within the time limit. In the early sections of the game, the bots simply stand around the level. Putty has to absorb them, and carry them to the level's goal (either a flying saucer or an elevator). Later on in the game, the bots will jump around platforms, often falling to their death.Invariably each level also contains various enemies. These enemies include Terminator carrots, Scouse sausages and sword-wielding spacemen. The enemies will attempt to hurt Putty in various ways. The attacks from some of the enemies will also hurt any bots that Putty is carrying at the time. If a bot is hurt four times it is killed, causing the player to have to find another bot to absorb.Putty is also able to use powerups that are scattered around each level. These range from simple points bonuses to temporary invulnerability, to Uncle Ted. Once this latter powerup is collected, a man with a Hammond Organ named Uncle Ted appears, and proceeds to play a tune, causing all of the enemies in the level to freeze.The sequel Putty Squad was only released for Super NES and only in PAL territories. It features Putty and nemesis Dweezil the cat teaming up to rescue other putties. It also features a two-player mode, with the second player taking control of a red putty. Versions of the game were completed and reviewed, but not published, for the Amiga and the Sega Mega Drive, with only a demo version for the Amiga being released on two magazine coverdisks. The complete Amiga version was finally released in December 2013 as a free Christmas gift from System 3, available on their website.[1] A PC MS-DOS version was also projected by System 3 and a demo version was released on magazine disks, but in the end this version was not even finished by the developer.On August 12, 2010, System 3 announced that a new version of Putty Squad will be available on PS3, iPhone, iPad and PSP.In Retro Gamer issue 39 Mark Cale stated that he would be bringing the Putty series to the Nintendo DS and PSP in 2008 and more details would be announced later in 2008. They're looking to bring a new game to the systems rather than a port of the two existing games.","title":"Putty","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/1f/Putty_Amiga.jpg/220px-Putty_Amiga.jpg","developer":"System 3","genre":"Platform"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_R.B.I._Baseball","description":"Super R.B.I.

The game has been re-released on the Wii Virtual Console in Japan, North America, and PAL regions in 2008.Super R-Type borrows four stages from R-Type II and adds three new ones. The game is known for its high difficulty (even compared to other games in the series), particularly because of its lack of checkpoints, since dying means restarting the level from scratch.[4] Also, this game suffers from slowdown, which was also a problem in many early games for this system.

As in the previous game, players battle waves of enemies by using guns; the arcade version even uses the two-joystick control system of Robotron. The plot of Smash TV revolves around a futuristic game show in which players compete for various prizes as well as their lives.The announcer in the game is voiced by sound designer Paul Heitsch. The script was created by the game's sole composer and sound designer Jon Hey. The voice of General Ahkboob in the follow-up game Total Carnage is Ed Boon, coding creator of Mortal Kombat. In the Smash TV flyer image [right] the hands at the console are Ed Boon's (left) and Jon Hey's (right).In an interview first made available on Arcade Party Pak, Eugene Jarvis and Mark Turmell both agreed that a Smash TV sequel had been contemplated.[5]Smash TV was ported to consoles, including the NES, SNES/Super Famicom (as Super Smash TV),[6] the Sega Game Gear, Sega Master System, Sega Genesis/Mega Drive (as Super Smash TV). On some home systems such as the NES, players have the option to use the directional pad on the second controller to control the direction the character will shoot on-screen. Using this option for both players requires a multitap.[7] The dual control aspect of the game works particularly well on the SNES, as its four main buttons, A, B, X and Y, are laid out like a D-pad, enabling the player to shoot in one direction while running in another.[8]It is also part of the Midway Arcade Treasures collection, which is available for the PC, Nintendo GameCube, Xbox and PlayStation 2 and was released in 2003. These versions give the player the option to save high scores.[20] Smash TV was also part of the 2012 compilation Midway Arcade Origins.[21]Smash TV was made available for download through Microsoft's Xbox Live Arcade service on the Xbox 360 and was the first version of the game to officially allow two players to play the game online.[22] However the game was delisted from the service in February 2010[23] after the dissolution of Midway Games.","title":"Smash TV","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/34/SmashTV_flyer.jpg/250px-SmashTV_flyer.jpg","developer":"Williams","genre":"Run and gun"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Soccer","description":"","title":"Super Soccer\nSuper Formation Soccer","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/2d/SupersoccerSNES_boxart.jpg/220px-SupersoccerSNES_boxart.jpg","developer":"Human Entertainment","genre":"Traditional soccer"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Soccer_Champ","description":"Football Champ is an arcade-style football (soccer) video game.

Super Star Wars features mostly run and gun gameplay, although it has stages which feature other challenges, such as driving a landspeeder or piloting an X-wing. It also features multiple playable characters with different abilities.The game was followed by two sequels based on the subsequent Star Wars films, Super Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back and Super Star Wars: Return of the Jedi.Super Star Wars generally follows the plot of Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope, although some allowances were made to adapt the story to suit an action game. For example, instead of simply buying C-3PO and R2-D2 from the Jawas, Luke Skywalker must fight his way to the top of a Jawa sandcrawler while leaping from a series of moving conveyor belts. Brief cutscenes between levels tell an abbreviated version of the film's story. Later stages allow the player to control smuggler and pilot Han Solo or Chewbacca the Wookiee. The game also features several vehicle-based levels in which the player takes control of an X-Wing or a landspeeder.A PC port of Super Star Wars was in the works since 1994, by a Danish game company Brain Bug and produced by Softgold. This version would deliver an enhanced audio-visual experience compared to the SNES version, with the levels and gameplay left intact. The game was almost completed but in 1995 LucasArts decided to halt the development and cancel the release.

It is the fourth game in the Street Fighter II sub-series of Street Fighter games, following Street Fighter II: Hyper Fighting. In addition to refining and balancing the existing character roster from the previous installments, Super Street Fighter II also introduced four new characters. It was also the first game to be developed on Capcom '​s CP System II hardware, which permitted more sophisticated graphics and audio over the original CP System hardware, used by the previous versions of Street Fighter II.Super Street Fighter II was followed by Super Street Fighter II Turbo, a fifth version of Street Fighter II released during the following year 1994, which further refined the balance between characters and introduced additional new features.Super Street Fighter II featured the following changes from Street Fighter II: Hyper Fighting.Super Street Fighter II features a new scoring system which kept track of combos, first attacks, reversals and recoveries made by the player and awards the player with bonus points by performing such deeds.In addition to the standard single and two-player game modes, Super Street Fighter II also feature an exclusive eight-player single-elimination tournament mode dubbed Tournament Battle. This mode is only available when four Super Street Fighter II arcade game cabinets are connected together and all of them configured to \"Tournament\" mode. The Tournament Mode consists of three sets of four simultaneous matches: the initial eliminations, the semifinals and the finals. After the first set is over, the players are re-arranged accordingly based on their position: the winning players sent to either of the first two cabinets, whereas losing players sent to one of the other two. In the finals, the players competing for first place are sent to the first cabinet, the third-place players to the second cabinet, and so on.The Super NES version of Super Street Fighter II, released on June 25, 1994 in Japan, and during the same month in North America and Europe, was the third Street Fighter game released for the console, following the original Street Fighter II and Street Fighter II Turbo (a port of Hyper Fighting). It was released on a 32 Megabit cartridge and featured support for the XBAND online network. The SNES port featured several new game modes such as Group Battle and a Time Challenge, as well as the eight-player Tournament mode from the arcade version, in addition to the previous games' Arcade and Versus modes. Due to hardware limitations, certain music and sound effects were replaced with different renditions. Like in the SNES version of Turbo, the background music stops playing between rounds, and as a result the music restarts from the beginning at the start of each round. Unlike the Genesis version, the SNES port has the blood for the character's beat up portraits removed or replaced with sweat (most likely due to Nintendo's strict policy during the early 90's).Super Street Fighter II was ported by Eurocom to the IBM-PC and compatibles (MSDOS CD-ROM) and Amiga in North America and Europe in 1995. Both ports were based on the SNES version.[citation needed]In the February 1994 issue of Gamest, Super Street Fighter II was nominated for Best Game of 1993, though it was eventually ranked at third. In the category of Best Fighting Games, Super won three more third place prizes in the categories of \"Best Fighting Games,\" \"Best Graphics,\" and \"Best VGM.\" Cammy, who was introduced in Super, placed fifth place in the list of Best Characters of 1993, with Dee Jay and T.

The titular SWAT Kats are two vigilante pilots who possess a state-of-the-art fighter jet with an array of weaponry. Throughout the series, they face various villains as well as Megakat City's militarized police force, the Enforcers.The show originally premiered and ran on TBS's syndication block The Funtastic World of Hanna-Barbera from 1993 to 1995.

When they objected, citing their already-acquired target lock, Commander Feral used his jet to slap their wing, sending Chance and Jake's jet crashing into Enforcer headquarters and allowing Dark Kat to get away. In his anger, Feral discharged Chance and Jake from the Enforcers and reassigned them to work at the city's military salvage yard to pay for the damage to the Enforcer Headquarters that Feral caused.Using discarded military parts and weapons from the salvage yard, Chance and Jake built themselves a three-engine jet fighter called the Turbokat, which resembled several different jet fighters, most notably the Grumman F-14 and the Saab Draken, along with a handful of other vehicles such as the Cyclotron (a motorcycle built into the jet), the Turbo Mole (a subterranean vehicle used to drill underground), the Hoverkat (a militarized hovercraft), and the Thunder Truck (a militarized Jeep modified from their tow truck). All these vehicles were stored, along with a training area and other equipment, in a secret hangar below the yard.T-Bone and Razor now patrol Megakat City as the SWAT Kats, defending it against any kind of menace that threatens the city. Their enemies include the criminal mastermind Dark Kat, the undead sorcerer Pastmaster, the mutant evil genius Doctor Viper, and the robotic gangsters the Metallikats. The SWAT Kats also face many villains-of-the-week, such as Madkat and Volcanus.The SWAT Kats keep their identities secret from everyone, including their closest ally Deputy Mayor Callie Briggs, who is arguably more important than the mayor himself (since she's the one who actually does all the work around City Hall). Their methods do not endear them to Commander Feral, and the three of them often clash throughout the series. In the second season, Feral's niece Felina (who holds a Lieutenant rank in the Enforcers) becomes another ally of the SWAT Kats.SWAT Kats became the number one syndicated animated show of 1994, according to Nielsen Television Index (NTI) and Nielsen Syndication Service (NSS).[6] Hanna Barbera Productions also stated this in a SWAT Kats Poster ad that they were going to release new episodes, posters, and other works in 1995.[6] Toon Magazine also published a section about the success of SWAT Kats in Fall 1994 issue.[7] Modelsheets of characters were also released in the same issue. The show was canceled with three unfinished episodes.[2] Hanna-Barbera ended their syndication block The Funtastic World of Hanna-Barbera to focus mostly on producing original content for Cartoon Network.Other countries have aired this series around the world.In July 1995, Hanna-Barbera released three VHS collections with two select episodes on each. These releases also included some of the \"Secret Files of SWAT Kats\" clips that ended each episode in original airings. The VHS releases were titled:\"Deadly Dr. Viper\" - featuring \"Destructive Nature\" and \"Katastrophe\".\"Strike of Dark Kat\" - featuring \"The Wrath of Dark Kat\" and \"Night of Dark Kat\".\"Metallikats Attack\" - featuring \"The Metallikats\" and \"Metal Urgency\".On December 14, 2010, Warner Archive released Swat Kats: The Radical Squadron- The Complete Series Collection on DVD in region 1, as part of their Hanna–Barbera Classics Collection. This is a Manufacture-on-Demand (MOD) release, available exclusively through Warner's online store and Amazon.com.[8] It should be noted though, that the episodes themselves aren't remastered, but are from the best quality master tapes available and contain no extras or bonus features aside from the episodes themselves. Three scenes that were originally cut from the show were released on DVD. They are the title card of the episode \"The Pastmaster Always Rings Twice\", the Farmer Scene from the episode \"The Giant Bacteria\" and the Guidance System scene from the episode \"Chaos in Crystal.\" But the \"Today on SWAT Kats\" and the \"Secret Files of SWAT Kats\" segments are not available on the DVD set.Most episodes of the series were originally preceded by a short prologue in which Razor would say, \"Today on Swat Kats...,\" with a brief action scene from the episode. After most episodes, there was a small clip called \"Secret Files of SWAT Kats\" which gave information about the Heroes and Villains from the show and Warner Bros didn't release any information about the 6 unfinished episodes of the show. Another issue with the DVD was the end credits of the show. Warner Bros put the end credits for the episodes in the wrong order, meaning voice actors either aren’t credited for episodes they were in, or are credited for ones they weren’t. Only a few episodes had their proper end credits in tact.On March 3, 2011, Warner Bros removed Swat Kats: The Radical Squadron from its DVD page, most likely to remove the current set, this is because on January 19, 2012, Warner Archive re-released the Swat Kats set with the end credits corrected, but still without the \"Today on SWAT Kats\" or the \"Secret Files of SWAT Kats\" segments.Remco produced a line of action figures in 1994 which included T-Bone, Razor, Dr. Viper and Dark Kat.[9] Both White Castle and Carl's Jr. have offered SWAT Kats toys in their kids' meals in the 1990s.The game SWAT Kats: The Radical Squadron developed by AIM was released by Hudson Soft in June 9, 1995 for Japan and August 21, 1995 in North America for the SNES. It is a 2-D Action Platformer with RPG elements in which you can play as either T-Bone or Razor. It features a password system and third-person flying sequences in the Turbokat Fighter. It is based on various episodes of the show and features a different boss for each world, with Dark Kat as the final boss. All worlds contain an urgent message from Mayor Manx prior to the start of each world.","title":"","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fb/SwatKatsseason2.jpg/240px-SwatKatsseason2.jpg","developer":"","genre":""},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndicate_(video_game)","description":"Syndicate is an isometric real-time tactical game from Bullfrog Productions created in 1993. It is the first title in the Syndicate series. An expansion pack, Syndicate: American Revolt, a sequel, Syndicate Wars, and a reboot Syndicate have also been released. The original game and expansion pack were re-released together in 1996 as Syndicate Plus.The backstory of Syndicate is contained in the manual, instead of the game itself.[1]The CHIP, like some drugs, also made the user open to auto-suggestion, allowing them to be manipulated by the Megacorps. The CHIP became a perfect tool for the Megacorps to manipulating the populace and to gain power with. It didn't take long before the Megacorps were corrupted and became crime Syndicates, fighting amongst each other for monopoly over CHIP manufacturing and control over the world.In January 2012, the DOS version of Syndicate was re-released, packaged with pre-configured versions of the DOSBox emulator for both OS X and modern versions of windows.[3]Computer Gaming World criticized the lack of multiplayer, random research, poor AI, and repetitive missions. The magazine concluded that \"Syndicate is a polished and significant effort\" that would appeal to fans of other Bullfrog games but \"doesn't quite offer the staying power of its predecessors\".[4] COMPUTE! noted, \"This isn't a game to use as a morality lesson for the kids – it's bloody, it requires you to be ruthless, and some people may take issue with the use of drugs to control your agents. But it's a ball to play.\"[5] On release in 1995, Famicom Tsūshin scored the Super Famicom version of the game a 22 out of 40.[6] The four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly scored the Jaguar version a 6.75 average, concurring that it was the best home console version of the game to date, but still clearly inferior to the PC version. They especially criticized the use of the Jaguar controller's number pad, saying it made the controls needlessly complicated.[7]In 1996, Computer Gaming World ranked it as the 67th best PC game of all time, stating that \"it was just fun to mow down civilians in this strategic action game of futuristic gang warfare.\"[8] That same year, Next Generation ranked it as the 29th top game of all time for being \"fast, furious and tons of fun\" in spite of its complexity.[9] Also in 1996, Syndicate was ranked as the seventh best Amiga game by Amiga Power.[10] In 2010, UGO.com included the game on its list of 42 best games ever made.[11] It was also included in the 2011 list of the best violent video games of all time by The Daily Telegraph for the reason that \"few games have ever been so keen to have their protagonists murder civilians, burning them with flamethrowers, blowing them up with rocket launchers and simply mowing them down.\"[12] That same year, Wirtualna Polska ranked it as the third best Amiga game.[13]Syndicate Wars is a 1996 direct sequel to Syndicate, featuring 3D graphics and released for the PC and PlayStation. Several attempts by Bullfrog to produce another Syndicate game were all ultimately abandoned. These canceled games included at least one for the PC and another for the PlayStation 2.[14] The game was re-imagined by Starbreeze Studios as Syndicate, a first-person shooter released for the PC, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in 2012.","title":"Syndicate","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4b/Syndicate_Coverart.png","developer":"Bullfrog Productions","genre":"Tactical shooting"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syvalion","description":"Syvalion (サイバリオン?) is an arcade video game released by Taito in 1988.

Originally an arcade game, Turtles in Time was ported to the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in 1992, whereupon it was retitled to serve as a sequel to Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III: The Manhattan Project. That same year, a game that borrowed many elements, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Hyperstone Heist was released for the Mega Drive/Sega Genesis.Years later, the arcade version of Turtles in Time was revisited on newer consoles.

Some of the games follow part of the plot of the films. The characters and related events are described, below, using in-universe tone.The first three films featured the concept of a \"terminator\", specifically the titular character, a virtually unstoppable cyborg assassin who is sent back from the year 2029 by a race of artificially intelligent, computer-controlled machines bent on the extermination of mankind. The Terminator's mission is to prevent Sarah Connor's son, John Connor, from forming a resistance against the machines. Rebel Kyle Reese tries to stop the Terminator. The first film became a pop-culture phenomenon, leading to various computer and video games. The games are either based directly on the movies or are heavily involved in the film series' expanded universe.There is a DOS computer action-adventure game based on the first movie. Developed and published by Bethesda Softworks in 1990, it was the first officially licensed game based on the Terminator film series, which allowed Bethesda to sublicense the film's rights for the console versions.This game was written in 100% assembly and takes up more than 35000 lines. The game contains approximately 20000 3D objects. It was developed using Turbo Assembler and Turbo Debugger with all debugging being done remotely. It was created on a variety of 286 and 386 computers. All graphics were created on IBMs and Amigas using DPIII and DA. More than 700 frames of animations were created. The delta mode compression yielded a 100-to-1 ratio.The player takes on the role of Kyle Reese and protects Sarah Connor from the cyborg sent back in time to kill her. Alternatively, the player can become the Terminator and eliminate Kyle and Sarah. Either way, the player chases his opponent through Los Angeles, buying or stealing weapons and equipment, while attempting to eliminate his enemy and avoid the police.The game takes place within a huge (roughly 10 × 6 miles or 16 × 10 kilometres) 3-D rendered area of central Los Angeles. The game area runs roughly from Beverly Drive to Central Ave (lengthwise), and from Mulholland Drive to National Blvd (vertically). A game map is included in the box for reference. Though the buildings and their placement within the world is generic, and highways/overpasses have been removed, the streets and their layout are largely accurate. The game also includes some landmarks, such as Dodger Stadium, Griffith Park, and the Silver Lake Reservoir.[1]A Terminator game for the NES platform had been in development since 1989. Sunsoft's game, Journey to Silius, was originally conceived as a game based on the original film. The license expired during production and the final game altered its graphics and created its own storyline.[2] A NES game was eventually developed and released in December 1992, it is a side-scrolling platformer developed by Radical Entertainment and published by Mindscape and Bethesda Softworks. The player plays as Kyle Reese, starting in the future, with a gun and grenades, fighting the way to SkyNet (encountering many Terminators and HK's in the process). Once arriving in 1984, the player is armed, initially, only with fists and baseballs. In driving stages, the player has a gun, but loses it right after the stage ends. It is considered to be one of the worst Terminator games. It received negative reviews for its bad graphics and level design, repetitive music, poor hit detection, and bad controls.This is a video game first released in 1992 based on the original 1984 film of the same name. It was coded by Probe Software and released by Virgin Games on all the Sega video game consoles available at the time (Mega Drive/Genesis, Master System, Game Gear). In 1993, another game coded by Virgin Games USA was developed and released by Virgin for the Mega-CD/Sega CD.The Terminator by Probe Software is an action shooter game for the Mega Drive/Genesis programmed by David Perry and scored by Matt Furniss. The main character, Kyle Reese, traverses through levels that closely parallel the movie's environment. In all levels, the main character has a jump and has various weapons throughout the game. The first level takes place in the future, and the main character has hand grenades, timed bombs, and a machine gun as weapon choices. The later levels take place in modern settings, and the primary weapon is a shotgun only. The final level takes place inside the Cyberdyne factory, where you battle the Terminator alone. The objective of this level is to lead the Terminator into a compactor which destroys him. Conversions of this very same game were also developed by Probe for the Master System and Game Gear.The Mega-CD/Sega CD version, released by Virgin Games USA, was an entirely revamped game which had all-new levels, with development based on the David Perry engine, and was noted for its musical score by Tommy Tallarico, Bijan Shaheer, Joey Kuras, and TeknoMan. This music is generated in Q Sound. The objective is identical to the movie, which involves future soldier Kyle Reese going through the Time Displacement equipment located inside a Skynet base in the year 2029 AD, to go back in time to Los Angeles 1984 to protect Sarah Connor from the Terminator. It is considered to be the best game based on the original The Terminator.The name in text on the scrolling intro, \"Hemdale's The Terminator\" (only in the Mega Drive/Genesis version) refers to the independent Hemdale Film Corporation, who produced the original movie. Once the studio closed, Orion Pictures became the owner of most of the films Hemdale had once owned.The SNES version is a Side-scrolling, shooter developed by Gray Matter and published by Mindscape in 1993 for the Super NES. The player plays as Kyle Reese trying to stop the Terminator from killing Sarah Connor. The main levels are side-scrolling shooters, the two sub-levels are pseudo-driving levels, where the player has to shoot the Terminator to stop him from shooting back. The game is very difficult, due to the length of the levels and the fact that the player gets no continues if losing all lives. There is minimal music in the game, as the sound effects tend to be much louder.A shoot 'em up developed by In-Fusio and Cybiko. It was released by In-Fusio in 2003 for the Mobile phone platforms BREW, ExEn and Java ME.An Action/Adventure beat 'em up that was released on NES and then ported to Sega Game Gear and Master System.

Level 2 is an isometric racing game, whereupon the player must race fast enough to catch John Conner on his moped whilst using weapons to beat back the T-1000, who is fast approaching in a tractor trailer. All the other levels are side-scrolling beat 'em ups. Level 2 is omitted from the Master System and Game Gear versions. From Level 3 onward, the player is not allowed to kill human enemies, to which he will be rewarded with upgraded weaponry at the end of levels for doing so. Level 4 requires the player to visit all ends of the gamescreen in order to set explosive charges. Levels 5 has the player doing some platforming, before finally taking on the T-1000 in the final battle.The Game Boy version is an action-adventure game developed by Bits Studios and published by LJN. It was released for the Game Boy in 1991.

The game was released in 1991 for the Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, Commodore 64, DOS, ZX Spectrum. The game is loosely based on the 2nd film of the same name.The story of the game falls inline with the movie Terminator 2: Judgment Day. The objective is to save the leader of the Human Resistance, John Connor, and his mother, Sarah, from the T-1000, a mimetic poly-alloy Terminator, bent on killing them both.The game was ported to numerous hardware platforms, with the contents of the levels being very similar and consistent. Versions of the game for the aging Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum featured very primitive graphics, compared to the other platform releases.A pinball game designed by Steve Ritchie and released by Williams Electronics in 1991. A follow-up to this game is Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines, featuring a very similar playfield design and rulesheet.An action-adventure game developed by Bits Studios, Probe Entertainment, and Arc Developments and published by Flying Edge and LJN for the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive and Super NES. respectively in 1993. Based on the film of the same name.One plays as the T-800 sent back in time to 1995, in order to protect John and Sarah Connor from the T-1000. There are two gameplay types: side-scrolling and driving. During the side-scrolling levels, the player's objective is to locate and retrieve all future objects, which are gray boxes with a flashing light on top, that, when broken open, look like endoskulls. The player must complete all objectives for that mission. Once all objectives are completed, the player goes back to the beginning of the level to finish the mission. Between the side-scrolling levels are the driving levels. During the driving levels, the player's objective is to drive to the next mission location by following compass directions, while avoiding pursuers.In the side-scrolling levels, the T-800 has 100% health to begin with, but gets 50% health from the secondary power supply if its health drops to 0%. If the secondary power supply drops to 0%, the T-800 dies and the game ends. In the driving levels, the T-800 has 100% vehicular health, but the game ends if the health reaches 0%.Starting with Level 3, the T-1000 will appear (or Level 2 if the alarm is tripped or too much time is spent there). The T-1000 attacks using a pistol and arms morphed into stabbing weapons. The T-1000 will mold back into shape if shot, but it will be temporarily incapacitated if it suffers enough damage. The T-1000 does not appear in level 6.The T-800 must also protect John Connor starting with Level 3, and Sarah Connor starting with Level 4. If either one loses all of their health, they will start dying, and the T-800 must heal them by ducking down over them and transferring some of its health to them. If they are left alone for too long, they die, and the game ends. However, Sarah Connor wields a pistol for extra defense. Neither one appears in levels 5 or 6.Both versions have different musical instrumentation, different sound effects, and some minor graphical and control differences, but are otherwise identical.The Chess Wars version is a chess/strategy game developed by IntraCorp and published by Capstone Software for DOS platforms in 1993. It is based on the Terminator film series.As the name suggests, Terminator 2: Judgment Day - Chess Wars is a chess game based on the film Terminator 2: Judgment Day.

The first film became a pop-culture phenomenon, leading to various computer and video games. The games are either based directly on the movies or are heavily involved in the film series' expanded universe.There is a DOS computer action-adventure game based on the first movie. Developed and published by Bethesda Softworks in 1990, it was the first officially licensed game based on the Terminator film series, which allowed Bethesda to sublicense the film's rights for the console versions.This game was written in 100% assembly and takes up more than 35000 lines. The game contains approximately 20000 3D objects. It was developed using Turbo Assembler and Turbo Debugger with all debugging being done remotely. It was created on a variety of 286 and 386 computers. All graphics were created on IBMs and Amigas using DPIII and DA. More than 700 frames of animations were created. The delta mode compression yielded a 100-to-1 ratio.The player takes on the role of Kyle Reese and protects Sarah Connor from the cyborg sent back in time to kill her. Alternatively, the player can become the Terminator and eliminate Kyle and Sarah. Either way, the player chases his opponent through Los Angeles, buying or stealing weapons and equipment, while attempting to eliminate his enemy and avoid the police.The game takes place within a huge (roughly 10 × 6 miles or 16 × 10 kilometres) 3-D rendered area of central Los Angeles. The game area runs roughly from Beverly Drive to Central Ave (lengthwise), and from Mulholland Drive to National Blvd (vertically). A game map is included in the box for reference. Though the buildings and their placement within the world is generic, and highways/overpasses have been removed, the streets and their layout are largely accurate. The game also includes some landmarks, such as Dodger Stadium, Griffith Park, and the Silver Lake Reservoir.[1]A Terminator game for the NES platform had been in development since 1989. Sunsoft's game, Journey to Silius, was originally conceived as a game based on the original film. The license expired during production and the final game altered its graphics and created its own storyline.[2] A NES game was eventually developed and released in December 1992, it is a side-scrolling platformer developed by Radical Entertainment and published by Mindscape and Bethesda Softworks. The player plays as Kyle Reese, starting in the future, with a gun and grenades, fighting the way to SkyNet (encountering many Terminators and HK's in the process). Once arriving in 1984, the player is armed, initially, only with fists and baseballs. In driving stages, the player has a gun, but loses it right after the stage ends. It is considered to be one of the worst Terminator games. It received negative reviews for its bad graphics and level design, repetitive music, poor hit detection, and bad controls.This is a video game first released in 1992 based on the original 1984 film of the same name. It was coded by Probe Software and released by Virgin Games on all the Sega video game consoles available at the time (Mega Drive/Genesis, Master System, Game Gear). In 1993, another game coded by Virgin Games USA was developed and released by Virgin for the Mega-CD/Sega CD.The Terminator by Probe Software is an action shooter game for the Mega Drive/Genesis programmed by David Perry and scored by Matt Furniss. The main character, Kyle Reese, traverses through levels that closely parallel the movie's environment. In all levels, the main character has a jump and has various weapons throughout the game. The first level takes place in the future, and the main character has hand grenades, timed bombs, and a machine gun as weapon choices. The later levels take place in modern settings, and the primary weapon is a shotgun only. The final level takes place inside the Cyberdyne factory, where you battle the Terminator alone. The objective of this level is to lead the Terminator into a compactor which destroys him. Conversions of this very same game were also developed by Probe for the Master System and Game Gear.The Mega-CD/Sega CD version, released by Virgin Games USA, was an entirely revamped game which had all-new levels, with development based on the David Perry engine, and was noted for its musical score by Tommy Tallarico, Bijan Shaheer, Joey Kuras, and TeknoMan. This music is generated in Q Sound. The objective is identical to the movie, which involves future soldier Kyle Reese going through the Time Displacement equipment located inside a Skynet base in the year 2029 AD, to go back in time to Los Angeles 1984 to protect Sarah Connor from the Terminator. It is considered to be the best game based on the original The Terminator.The name in text on the scrolling intro, \"Hemdale's The Terminator\" (only in the Mega Drive/Genesis version) refers to the independent Hemdale Film Corporation, who produced the original movie. Once the studio closed, Orion Pictures became the owner of most of the films Hemdale had once owned.The SNES version is a Side-scrolling, shooter developed by Gray Matter and published by Mindscape in 1993 for the Super NES. The player plays as Kyle Reese trying to stop the Terminator from killing Sarah Connor. The main levels are side-scrolling shooters, the two sub-levels are pseudo-driving levels, where the player has to shoot the Terminator to stop him from shooting back. The game is very difficult, due to the length of the levels and the fact that the player gets no continues if losing all lives. There is minimal music in the game, as the sound effects tend to be much louder.A shoot 'em up developed by In-Fusio and Cybiko. It was released by In-Fusio in 2003 for the Mobile phone platforms BREW, ExEn and Java ME.An Action/Adventure beat 'em up that was released on NES and then ported to Sega Game Gear and Master System. Developed by Software Creations and published by LJN on NES and by Flying Edge on Sega systems. It is based on the film of the same name.The game consists of five levels. Level 2 is an isometric racing game, whereupon the player must race fast enough to catch John Conner on his moped whilst using weapons to beat back the T-1000, who is fast approaching in a tractor trailer. All the other levels are side-scrolling beat 'em ups. Level 2 is omitted from the Master System and Game Gear versions. From Level 3 onward, the player is not allowed to kill human enemies, to which he will be rewarded with upgraded weaponry at the end of levels for doing so. Level 4 requires the player to visit all ends of the gamescreen in order to set explosive charges. Levels 5 has the player doing some platforming, before finally taking on the T-1000 in the final battle.The Game Boy version is an action-adventure game developed by Bits Studios and published by LJN. It was released for the Game Boy in 1991. It is based on the film of the same name.A platform game with top-down perspective levels that was published by Ocean Software based on the earlier NES version by LJN. The game was released in 1991 for the Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, Commodore 64, DOS, ZX Spectrum.

The objective is to save the leader of the Human Resistance, John Connor, and his mother, Sarah, from the T-1000, a mimetic poly-alloy Terminator, bent on killing them both.The game was ported to numerous hardware platforms, with the contents of the levels being very similar and consistent. Versions of the game for the aging Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum featured very primitive graphics, compared to the other platform releases.A pinball game designed by Steve Ritchie and released by Williams Electronics in 1991. A follow-up to this game is Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines, featuring a very similar playfield design and rulesheet.An action-adventure game developed by Bits Studios, Probe Entertainment, and Arc Developments and published by Flying Edge and LJN for the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive and Super NES. respectively in 1993. Based on the film of the same name.One plays as the T-800 sent back in time to 1995, in order to protect John and Sarah Connor from the T-1000. There are two gameplay types: side-scrolling and driving. During the side-scrolling levels, the player's objective is to locate and retrieve all future objects, which are gray boxes with a flashing light on top, that, when broken open, look like endoskulls. The player must complete all objectives for that mission. Once all objectives are completed, the player goes back to the beginning of the level to finish the mission. Between the side-scrolling levels are the driving levels. During the driving levels, the player's objective is to drive to the next mission location by following compass directions, while avoiding pursuers.In the side-scrolling levels, the T-800 has 100% health to begin with, but gets 50% health from the secondary power supply if its health drops to 0%. If the secondary power supply drops to 0%, the T-800 dies and the game ends. In the driving levels, the T-800 has 100% vehicular health, but the game ends if the health reaches 0%.Starting with Level 3, the T-1000 will appear (or Level 2 if the alarm is tripped or too much time is spent there). The T-1000 attacks using a pistol and arms morphed into stabbing weapons. The T-1000 will mold back into shape if shot, but it will be temporarily incapacitated if it suffers enough damage. The T-1000 does not appear in level 6.The T-800 must also protect John Connor starting with Level 3, and Sarah Connor starting with Level 4. If either one loses all of their health, they will start dying, and the T-800 must heal them by ducking down over them and transferring some of its health to them. If they are left alone for too long, they die, and the game ends. However, Sarah Connor wields a pistol for extra defense. Neither one appears in levels 5 or 6.Both versions have different musical instrumentation, different sound effects, and some minor graphical and control differences, but are otherwise identical.The Chess Wars version is a chess/strategy game developed by IntraCorp and published by Capstone Software for DOS platforms in 1993.

Manga artist Kamui Fujiwara is credited with the character designs. It was published by Enix (now Square Enix) in Japan before Nintendo localized the game and released English, German, French and Spanish versions in Europe and Australia. The game has never been officially released in North America. Terranigma tells the story of the Earth's resurrection by the hands of a boy named Ark, and its progress from the evolution of life to the present day.In Terranigma, the planet (a fictional Earth) is portrayed as a hollow sphere that has both an external and internal face.[3] Since the beginning of the Earth, the external Lightside, the surface world, stood for growth whereas the internal Darkside, the under world, represented decline.[4] Over the course of billions of years, these two forces came to be called God and Devil.[4] Regardless of this inner antagonism, rapid progress took root and primitive life forms evolved to plants, animals, and humans. Technology and industry further expanded civilization, but the fight between God and the Devil was still taking place, more fiercely than ever. The conflict culminated in a final battle in Antarctica, on the surface world. However, neither of the two forces were victorious. The continents of the surface world submerged into the sea and the under world was sealed away.Terranigma was developed by the Japanese company Quintet, which had previously designed creation-themed Super Nintendo games such as ActRaiser and Soul Blazer.[9] Publisher Enix commissioned the developers as a subcontractor and decided for the title to be an action role-playing game for strategic reasons, based on Quintet's experience in that particular genre and the good reception of their earlier games by the Japanese audience.[9] The theme of creation prevalent in Terranigma was introduced as a contrast to the destruction of enemies in other action titles, and to inspire the player's imagination concerning the effects their actions might have.[9] The script of the game was written by director and designer Tomoyoshi Miyazaki, the founder of Quintet, with the scenario provided by Reiko Takebayashi.[8] Tatsuo Hashimoto created the computer graphics cover art and also rendered the background images for the resurrection scenes.[8][10] The music of Terranigma was composed by Miyoko Takaoka and Masanori Hikichi, the latter of whom was responsible for the design of the sounds as well.[11][12] The game is the last title in a loosely connected trilogy consisting of Quintet's Soul Blazer and Illusion of Gaia.[13][14] Unlike its predecessors, however, Terranigma wound up never being published in North America because Enix had already closed its US subsidiary by the time the localization was finished.[13][14] The English scripts of the game used in the European and Australian releases by Nintendo were translated by Colin Palmer, Dan Owsen and Hiro Nakamura.[8]Terranigma was released alongside several pieces of merchandise in Japan, including an official guide book, a world atlas, a novel by Saori Kumi, a novelization by Norio Nakai titled Logout Bunko Tenchi Sōzō, a gamebook featuring artwork by character designer Kamui Fujiwara,[8] and the two volume manga Gangan Fantasy Comics: Tenchi Sōzō by Mamiko Yasaka.[15][16] Except the guide book, none of these materials have been released outside of Japan, though in Germany, Club Nintendo published a 32-page comic illustrating scenes from the game up to the events of the third chapter.[17]On release, Famicom Tsūshin scored the game a 30 out of 40.[18] According to developer Quintet, Tenchi Sōzō sold 200,000 copies in Japan.[19] Jeremy Parish of 1UP.com's Retronauts podcast described it as the game with the best reputation in Quintet's creation trilogy.[14] He remarked that the series was \"full of solid gameplay, great music and surprisingly deep story themes\", and that Terranigma exceeded both Soul Blazer and Illusion of Gaia, \"making it a long-coveted classic\".[13] Parish also expressed his wish for the title to be released on the Wii's Virtual Console download service.[13] Kei Kuboki of the video game magazine GameFan described it as the developer's \"best (...) effort\", and as being \"among the [Super Nintendo's] most memorable titles\".[9]","title":"Terranigma","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/bc/Terranigma_box_art.png/220px-Terranigma_box_art.png","developer":"Quintet","genre":"Action role-playing game"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris_%26_Dr._Mario","description":"Tetris & Dr. Mario refers to a 1994 compilation video game for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System containing the two following puzzle games:","title":"","developer":"","genre":""},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tetris_2_(video_game)&action=edit&redlink=1","description":"Other reasons this message may be displayed:\n","title":"","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b4/Wiktionary-logo-en.png/28px-Wiktionary-logo-en.png","developer":"","genre":""},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris_Attack","description":"Tetris Attack is a 1996 puzzle video game developed by Intelligent Systems and published by Nintendo for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and Game Boy. It is the first game in the Puzzle League series. While it was originally known in Japan as Panel de Pon for the Super Famicom and featured different art assets and characters, its English localization was replaced with characters from Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island. It was released on the Game Boy under the same name. The Game Boy release of the Yoshi version was also later released in Japan. On November 3, 1996, a version was released for the Super Famicom's Satellaview satellite modem service as BS Yoshi's Panepon (ＢＳヨッシーのパネポン, Bī Esu Yosshī no Panepon?). This game is similar to the Baku Baku Animal, developed by Sega in 1995.In Tetris Attack, the player is presented with a playfield consisting of a virtual grid of squares, each of which can be occupied by a colored block. Blocks are stacked on top of one another and rise steadily toward the top of the playfield, with new blocks being added at the bottom. The player must arrange blocks in horizontal or vertical lines of three or more matching colors by swapping blocks horizontally two at a time. As matching lines are formed, the blocks are cleared from the screen and any blocks above them fall into the gaps. The game is over when the blocks touch the top of the playfield, or another game-ending condition is met (such as reaching a time limit or clearing blocks below a set line).Tetris Attack provides several single-player modes. Story Mode takes the player through the game's main plot, pitting the player against a series of foes in a head-to-head match. The objective is to cause the computer-controlled player to lose. In Endless Mode, the player is challenged to play as long as possible with a continuously rising stack of blocks, which increases in speed over time. Timed Mode challenges the player to score as many points as possible within a two-minute time limit, and Stage Clear mode takes the player through a series of stages in which the objective is to clear blocks below a set line. A Puzzle Mode is also provided, which presents the player with a number of puzzles where he or she must clear all of the blocks in a set number of moves (Blocks do not rise in this mode).In addition to the game's single-player modes, Tetris Attack also provides several multiplayer modes that are essentially two-player variants of the single-player modes. One or both human players may be substituted with a computer-controlled player with a selectable difficulty level.Tetris Attack was originally released as Panel de Pon which was released on October 27, 1995 in Japan. An altered version of the original Panel de Pon was also released via Satellaview in 1998 under the name BS Panel De Pon - Event '98. The original Panel de Pon was released in Japan on the Wii's Virtual Console service on November 27, 2007. Tetris Attack's gameplay remains the same but the characters were changed from Panel de Pon '​s original characters to characters based on Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island. In Panel de Pon, the evil devil king Thanatos has cast a spell over the world of Popples to cause fighting amongst the fairies. The Fairy of Flowers, Lip, is unaffected due to her magic stick. Lip must defeat each of her fairy friends in a puzzle game to return their personalities to normal, then proceed to face off against Thanatos. Upon completion of Hard Mode, the player discovers that the final boss, the goddess Cordelia, is actually Lip's mother and queen of the fairies. She informs Lip that the events leading up to this moment were a test to see if Lip had the strength to become the new Queen of the next generation of fairies. In the version of Panel de Pon released as part of Nintendo Puzzle Collection for the GameCube, similar but younger fairies take the place of the original characters, and several new characters and stages have been added. The plot is otherwise very similar; however, the ending is very different. Other changes include a password system and improved AI over Panel de Pon. While it uses some new tracks based on Yoshi's Island, all of the in-game music in Tetris Attack remains unchanged from Panel de Pon. The original Panel de Pon soundtrack was scored by Masaya Kuzume. The music tracks from Yoshi's Island were arranged by Fire Emblem composer Yuka Tsujiyoko. The demo theme is \"Lip's Theme\", which would later be remixed for Super Smash Bros. Brawl.When Nintendo came to us, and said \"we would like to take this Japanese game called Panel de Pon, and rename it Tetris Attack\", I’m saying, \"it’s not Tetris\". ... In retrospect, we should never have done that. I don’t think that’s a good idea. It dilutes the brand, it’s like naming another cartoon character Mickey Mouse just cause you need the money.In Super Smash Bros. Melee, Super Smash Bros. Brawl, and Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U, one of the various objects that Kirby randomly transforms into when using his \"Stone\" (down+B) special attack is one of Lip's garbage blocks from Panel de Pon. Also in the games, there is an item called Lip's Stick, named after the Panel de Pon character replaced by Yoshi for Tetris Attack. Lip's Stick poisons the opponent that it contacts, as a flower is planted atop his or her head. While some in-game graphics exclusive to the Japanese market were replaced with more recognizable items, Lip's Stick was left as-is with its trophy explaining its Japanese-only origin. Also present in Brawl are four collectible Stickers depicting characters from the Nintendo Puzzle Collection iteration of Panel de Pon, marking the first time a Panel de Pon character is intentionally shown to audiences outside of Japan. The character stickers, however, had their names translated to those of the Super Famicom characters. The red heart block is also present. The game also includes a remix of Lip's theme, which plays on the PictoChat stage. Lip also appears in Captain Rainbow for the Wii.Tetris Attack was met with very positive reviews, earning a 90% average rating on Gamerankings.[2] GamesRadar listed it 87th on their list of \"The 100 best games of all time\", stating \"you haven’t lived until you’ve played TA two-player and dropped an immensely satisfying five line garbage block on your opponent.\"[3] Game Informer featured it on its own best games of all-time list at 96 and called it one of the most addictive puzzle games ever made.[4]","title":"Tetris Attack","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/9c/Tetris_Attack_box_art.png/270px-Tetris_Attack_box_art.png","developer":"Intelligent Systems","genre":"Puzzle"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theme_Park_(video_game)","description":"Theme Park is a construction and management simulation game designed by Bullfrog Productions and originally released in 1994, in which the player designs and operates an amusement park.There is a focus in the staff side of the park as well.

Lack of staff can cause problems, including messy footpaths, rides breaking down (and with sufficient neglect, exploding), crime, and unhappy visitors. Occasionally, wages and the price of goods must be negotiated; failure to negotiate results in staff strikes and loss of shipment. Theme Park offers three levels of simulation, with the higher difficulties requiring more management of aspects such as logistics.Bullfrog has since released two sequels: Theme Park World (sold as Sim Theme Park in the United States and some other places) and Theme Park Inc (also known as SimCoaster).The Saturn version was given a 90% in Sega Saturn Magazine, which praised it for retaining the original intro, music, speech samples, and features of the PC version (all of which had been left out of most previous console versions).[4] Electronic Gaming Monthly similarly praised the Saturn version for being a comprehensive port of the PC original, giving it an average score of 8.0, and applauded the addictive simulation gaming of Theme Park, calling it \"SimCity with a playful spirit.\"[5]","title":"Theme Park","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/de/Theme_Park_cover.jpg/220px-Theme_Park_cover.jpg","developer":"Bullfrog Productions","genre":"Construction and management sim"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_the_Tank_Engine_%26_Friends_(video_game)","description":"Thomas the Tank Engine & Friends is a video game based on Shining Time Station and the Thomas the Tank Engine & Friends television series released on August 2, 1993.

During the same year, it was retooled into an arcade game named Thunder Force AC. In 1991, Thunder Force AC was ported to the Super NES/Super Famicom, renamed Thunder Spirits.The setting of Thunder Force III takes place about 100 years after Thunder Force and directly after Thunder Force II.For Thunder Force III, the free-directional, overhead stage format featured in the previous two games is removed and replaced entirely by the horizontally aligned stage format. The horizontal format becomes the new standard for the following games.Due to the success of Technosoft's Thunder Force III for the Mega Drive (Sega Genesis), it was decided that the game would be brought to the arcade scene under the named Thunder Force AC. Ported to Sega's System C-2 hardware, Thunder Force AC is almost graphically identical to its Mega Drive counterpart, with only very minor and often unnoticeable differences.Thunder Force AC has been described as a retooling of Thunder Force III because it borrows enemies and stages from the earlier Thunder Force II, as well as adding some original content.

However, it turns into an semi-isometric view like in Streets of Rage once enemies appear on the screen. The Tick's signature humor is also present in various parts of the game, such as his unorthodox gestures and \"Spoon!\" battle cry after completing a level (and starting a level in the Genesis version). 44 levels make up the game with \"wobble\" environments and arcade style graphics.[1]However, in contrast to the popular animated series it was based on, the game was panned by critics. While the accurate graphics and jazzy background music were moderately well received, the game was criticized for having seemingly generic hordes of ridiculous lookalike enemies to combat and the limited punch-and-kick style.

Darien Lambert (Dale Midkiff) is a police detective of that period who is sent back to 1993 in order to apprehend as many of the fugitives as possible.[6] He is assisted by the Specified Encapsulated Limitless Memory Archive, or SELMA (Elizabeth Alexander), an extremely small but very powerful computer (described as equivalent to a mainframe) disguised for the mission as an AT&T MasterCard and communicated through a holographic interface which takes the visual form of a prim British nanny. Lambert is also equipped with an MPPT (Micro-Pellet Projection Tube) disguised as a keyless car alarm remote, which can stun targets or engulf them in an energy field, rendering them transportable to the future. This process, executed by SELMA, incorporates a transmission sequence to send the criminal on his way. Dr. Mordecai Sahmbi (Peter Donat), who was responsible for sending the fugitives to 1993, tries several times to kill Lambert.Captain Lambert, fearing the possible consequences of altering the timeline, does not actively attempt to interfere with the natural flow of history, although he frequently leaves messages for his colleagues in 2193 (via the 'personals' sections of assorted newspapers). However, the series makes occasional allusions to a theory of parallel timelines, implying that time travelers go into an alternate past so that their actions there have no effect on the 2193 \"present\".\"It began in the future.

His name is Darien Lambert and this is his story.\"~ Captain, Fugitive Retrieval SectionPre-Series (pilot narration)He was born on August 17, 2160, 8:05 AM, Monday. He was left at the Bradwell orphanage (#35 \"Mother\"). Unclaimed by his birth parents; he was raised in Enclave I-6 Middle City, the area known long before as Chicago Land. As was the custom, he was allowed to choose his own name. He chose Darien, hero of the Just War of 2129, and Lambert, the surname of the woman who bore him; whom he called mother even though all he had of her was her photograph.He grew up a normal child of his times: IQ 204, Speed Memorization rate 1.2 pages per second (slightly above average). He was a competent athlete. His best speed for the 100 meters was 8.6 seconds, and for the Mile Run - 3 minutes 38 seconds. He wondered how the Olympic Champion could ever have done it twenty seconds faster. His heartbeat was a normal 35 beats per minute. His life expectancy - 120 years. His lungs were average, capable of air storage up to six minutes. Beta wave training had given his generation mind control capabilities unavailable fifty years before his birth. One of these was the ability to slow down the speed of visual images reaching the brain, popularly called \"time stalling\". It demanded rigorous training.He was a solitary child; he lived among his memories. He was also a patriot. He admitted this to no one, because it was out of fashion. But he had feelings for his native land, once called the United States, and knew every detail of her history. He admired her early Fugitive Retrieval Specialists, the U.S. Marshals, and wondered why in later times so many of her criminals went unpunished. This belief system took him on a career path: The International Police Academy at West Point on Hudson.In the same year, Dr. Mordecai Sahmbi of MIT won the Nobel Prize for physics for his theoretical work in the teletransportation of particle mass. Halfway around the earth, Sahmbi is idolized by the brilliant young prodigy, Elyssa Channing-Knox (Mia Sara). About to be accepted at MIT, she is nine years old. By the time she is 17, she will have become his most gifted student. These two people will change Lambert's life forever.At West Point, Lambert excels; he learns Mosh-T an occidental improvement of martial arts. He becomes expert with the Pellet Projection Tube, the standard police weapon of the day. He graduates first in his class and is commissioned a Detective, Junior Grade. He is a marshal at last. The years that follow are turbulent to Lambert. He learns the eternal lesson of his trade; a policeman stands alone. Nor is his isolation made easier by being a member of a minority race. [The crowd chants 'blanco'.] It is the 22nd century's most abrasive racial slur. His experiences have made him strong, yet by decade's end, a series of events have begun to shake his confidence.His arrest record declines sharply. Routine track-downs end in mysterious disappearances. Suspects vanish without a trace. He begins to doubt his ability. Then, one day in the summer of '92 ...

They fought with one another and worried about each other. By the end of the series, SELMA almost \"mothered\" Darien and, despite her programming, admitted a deep pride in him. By all appearances the feeling was mutual. Selma was disguised as a credit card that Darien always carried with him. Selma communicated with both a voice and a holographic interface based on a picture of Darien's mother. It is revealed that SELMA can change her outward holographic appearance if Darien so desires. Additionally, SELMA can place phone calls, perform medical and scientific testing as well as interface with virtually any computer including those belonging to law enforcement agencies. Using this ability, SELMA has created marshals' credentials. Additionally, using this ability, SELMA has also made travel reservations for Darien as well performing research from contemporary sources. SELMA also has a vast amount of information in her database; this encompasses everything from technical manuals to cookbooks and historical facts.Dr. Mordecai SahmbiCharlie \"C.L.\" BurkeSepp DietrichElyssa Channing-KnoxAnnie Knox (Mia Sara)Fugitive Retrieval SergeantCountry singer Caitlin Carlisle (Kassie Wesley DePaiva)Joey MillerTime Trax was filmed in and around Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.[3] It was the last series to premiere under the Lorimar Productions name.[citation needed]Created by:Regulars:Recurring characters:On October 9, 2012, Warner Bros. released the complete first season on DVD in Region 1 via their Warner Archive Collection.

It shares many gameplay elements with Midway's previous title Smash TV.In Total Carnage, an evil Middle Eastern dictator named General Akhboob closes off his country to the rest of the world following a war in 1999. Hundreds of reporters flocked to the zone in hopes of getting a real scoop. Unfortunately for them, one of the reporters discovers that there's more than baby milk being made at the 'Baby Milk Factory'.Like Smash TV, Total Carnage features top-down shooter gameplay where the left joystick moves the player and the right joystick shoots. The player can enter a password at the start of the game to warp the player to anywhere in the game. The player gets a temporary shield per bomb drop (in some cases, this might not happen). The weapons have been modified, at death, the user gets a rapid-fire gun instead of the normal gun, the rocket launcher now also shoots ball-bullets and is slower, the game also features two types of a Flamethrower, one that shoots regular fire, one that shoots blue fire at larger ranges. The Grenade Lobber is faster than its Smash TV counterpart, and it shoots blue grenades instead of yellow and grey ones.Jon Hey followed up his sound creation for Smash TV with the sound and music for Total Carnage. Ed Boon, who created Mortal Kombat for Midway along with John Tobias, was the voice of General Akhboob. The game was developed with most of the people behind Smash TV.According to programmer Shawn Liptak, Total Carnage failed to reach the target of 2,000 arcade cabinets ordered.

The remake was published by Seika. An MS-DOS port was also released.They'd just reached the second pile of boxes when, out of reach and covered in cobwebs, they saw a box with the word \"WARNING!\" in bright red written across it. Like bees to a honeypot they hurriedly cleared everything away and carefully dragged it out where they could see it better. The box read: \"WARNING! Instant magical Troddlers - Just add water. May turn into zombified variety if allowed to teleport. DO NOT TOUCH!\" This, of course, sounded highly intriguing to the naughty duo who instantly decided they ought to investigate further.Unknown to them, Divinius had been plotting behind their backs. He was so fed up with their pranks that he decided to try to make some Troddlers (small, artificially created men) so they could one day replace Hokus and Pokus.Naturally, their first thought was \"I wonder whether we could get some of these Troddlers to clear up for us whilst we maybe have a little snooze!\" They were both in such a rush to be the first to get at the Troddlers that they ripped the box and spilled Troddlers powder in their cleaning bucket. There were bubbles, ripples, and then splashes and jets of water as the powder turned into Troddlers who burst out of the bucket and all over the floor. There were hundreds of them. The Troddlers, who apparently have animal-like minds, instinctively began walking toward a teleporter (which appeared to be a little door) at the far end of the storeroom as if they were hypnotized. Hokus and Pokus had no idea what to do.In Troddlers, you play as Hokus alone in solo mode. In multiplayer modes, player 2 plays as Pokus. The game is broken up into missions. Before each mission, a screen telling the mission objective and a few facts about the level (such as the number of Troddlers) is shown. A player must complete whatever task is given to him within the time limit (usually a few minutes). There are three main objectives that appear in the game: the more common objective involves leading stray Troddlers to an exit, somewhat similar to the gameplay in Lemmings. Another objective commonly given is the destruction of zombie Troddlers. The third involves collecting gems. Many levels combine two of these objectives and sometimes all three. There are, naturally, many obstacles and enemies throughout the game.Unlike in Lemmings, Troddlers places you in control of a character on the screen, thus adding some platforming elements to game. One of the game's distinguishing features is the ability to magically place and erase building blocks, like in Solomon's Key. These blocks are the size of the player, and can be placed in any direction next to the wizard placing it as long as there isn't an object the same size of the block in that area already. The main purpose of these blocks is to form a path to the exit for the wandering Troddlers. When a block is erased, it is stored visibly in a tube to the right of the screen. This tube displays how many blocks the player is holding, and when it is empty, no blocks can be placed. Up to 15 blocks can be stored in the tube, and once it becomes full, no blocks can be erased unless a stored block is placed somewhere else on the screen (thus freeing a space in the storage tube). There are many different types of blocks in the game, each of which has its own special effect. The block on the bottom of the storage tube is always the one placed, and when a block is erased, it is automatically stored on the top. In multiplayer modes, each character has their own storage tube. It is possible to erase a block while jumping from it at the same time, which allows players to climb up to high heights without obtaining and stacking numerous blocks.Troddlers themselves are never wandering around in a level to begin with; they always enter from a special entrance after a fixed amount of time. These creatures will always walk in the same direction if left undisturbed. Also, they can walk on walls and ceilings. Each level involving the rescue of Troddlers includes at least one exit in which the Troddlers must exit. These exits are sometimes placed sideways on walls or upside-down on ceilings.Zombie Troddlers behave in the same manner as normal Troddlers. If one happens to make contact with a normal Troddler, both will die and become a cloud of dust. These zombies will also use exits in levels as normal Troddlers do. When a zombie exits a level, it does not count as destroyed. The player must be careful not to let zombies near an exit during a mission that involves the destruction of a certain number of zombies. Before each mission that includes zombie Troddlers, the mission screen will display how many there are and whether they are \"lethal\" or \"harmless\". Both varieties will destroy normal Troddlers (as well as themselves) on contact, but only the lethal type can damage Hokus or Pokus by touching them.There are three different colors of gems that appear in the game; red, green, and blue. Stages will always specify how many of each color you must gather. Sometimes the gems are already present when the mission starts, but at other times a player must manufacture them. This is done with rocks. When a rock is dropped on a certain object, both the rock and the object will be destroyed and up to four gems will form. If there are walls or other objects right next to where the rock makes contact, it will prevent one gem from forming there. Placing a rock on a Troddler (including zombies) will result in red gems. Sometimes a mission will require you to rescue only a few Troddlers, thus leaving a few spare victims if you are required to create some red gems. Hurling a rock onto another rock results in the formation of green gems. When a non-Troddler enemy is plunked with a rock, blue gems appear.Rocks, like blocks, are the size of Hokus and Pokus. However, rocks cannot be erased; they must be pushed. Also, Troddlers cannot walk on them. If a Troddler encounters a rock on the ground, it will walk the other way. While trekking up a wall or ceiling, Troddlers will fall if they happen to run into a rock.Each building block in the game will affect Troddlers who set foot onto them in a different way. However, the effects do not apply to Hokus and Pokus.The most common blocks. Troddlers can walk all over them without any trouble.Troddlers cannot walk up the slippery surface of an ice block. If a Troddler encounters one on the ground, it will simply turn around and walk the other way. While walking on walls or the ceiling, however, the Troddler will fall. It will, of course, survive a short fall.When Troddlers touch them, they explode. This will destroy both the mine and the Troddler who touched it. A few other objects, including other blocks, can be destroyed in a nearby mine explosion.They cannot be erased or placed by Hokus and Pokus. These strange contraptions will allow Troddlers to pass through them freely, but to Hokus and Pokus they are no different from walls.These guns will always fire in a straight line. Many objects (including blocks, gems, and Troddlers) hit by a cannonball will be destroyed. They will also damage Hokus and Pokus. The only way to get rid of a cannon is to reflect one of its bullets back at it using a bouncer block.Hokus and Pokus can walk on them without trouble, but Troddlers are not so fortunate. If a Troddler ventures onto the sharp and rotating edge of a grinder, it will disintegrate into countless pieces.These artificial contraptions will spit out fire directly in front of wherever it's facing. Their fire will damage wizards and destroy any blocks or Troddlers in its path.These little balls of fire will roam freely around the stage. They will destroy any Ice blocks or Troddlers they come across and also damage Hokus and Pokus upon contact. Fireballs cannot climb up walls, and they will fall down any hole they happen to move over.These troublemaking birds fly freely around the stage. They do not harm Troddlers, but they can deplete the health of Hokus and Pokus if touched. When a bird flies over a block, it occasionally will peck it to smithereens. This can be especially troublesome when blocks are scarce.These odd creatures move freely across floors, walls, and ceilings looking for Troddlers to flip. If it comes into contact with a Troddler on the ground, the Troddler will simply fall over unharmed, but touching a spinner on the wall or the ceiling causes Troddlers to lose their balance and plummet to the ground. If a block is erased while a spinner is moving on it, that spinner will turn into a single blue gem.For two players looking to compete with each other. In war mode, Pokus (player 2) has become zombified and is allied with the zombie Troddlers. There are 15 missions, and whoever completes the mission objective first is the winner. The death of a player results in an automatic forfeit. Normal Troddlers are treated as zombies (and vice-versa) to Pokus in war mode.

Ultima was created by Richard Garriott, a.k.a. Lord British. Several games of the series are considered seminal entries in their genre. Electronic Arts currently holds the brand.The main Ultima series consists of nine installments (the seventh title is further divided into two parts) grouped into three trilogies, or \"Ages\": The Age of Darkness (Ultima I-III), The Age of Enlightenment (Ultima IV-VI), and The Age of Armageddon (Ultima VII-IX). The last is also sometimes referred to as \"The Guardian Saga\" after its chief antagonist. The first trilogy is set in a fantasy world named Sosaria, but during the cataclysmic events of The Age of Darkness, it is sundered and three quarters of it vanish. What is left becomes known as Britannia, a realm ruled by the benevolent Lord British, and is where the later games mostly take place. The protagonist in all the games is a canonically male resident of Earth who is called upon by Lord British to protect Sosaria and, later, Britannia from a number of dangers. Originally, the player character was referred to as \"the Stranger\", but by the end of Ultima IV he becomes universally known as the Avatar.In Ultima I: The First Age of Darkness (1981),[1] the Stranger is first summoned to Sosaria to defeat the evil wizard Mondain who aims to enslave it. Since Mondain possesses the Gem of Immortality, which makes him invulnerable, the Stranger locates a time machine, travels back in time to kill Mondain before he creates the Gem, and shatters the incomplete artifact.Ultima II: The Revenge of the Enchantress (1982) details Mondain's secret student and lover Minax's attempt to avenge him. Minax launches an attack on the Stranger's homeworld of Earth. Her actions cause doorways to open to various times and locations throughout Earth's history, and brings forth legions of monsters to all of them. The Stranger, after obtaining the Quicksword that alone can harm her, locates the evil sorceress at Castle Shadowguard at the origin of time and defeats her.Ultima III: Exodus (1983) reveals that Mondain and Minax had an offspring, the eponymous Exodus, \"neither human, nor machine\", according to the later games (it is depicted as a computer at the conclusion of the game, and it appears to be a demonic, self-aware artificial intelligence). Some time after Minax's death, Exodus starts his own attack on Sosaria and the Stranger is summoned once again to destroy it. Exodus was the first installment of the series featuring a player party system, which was used in many later games.Ultima IV: Quest of the Avatar (1985) marked a turning point in the series from the traditional \"hero vs. villain\" plots, instead introducing a complex alignment system based upon the Eight Virtues derived from the combinations of the Three Principles of Love, Truth and Courage. Although Britannia now prospers under Lord British's rule, he fears for his subjects' spiritual well-being and summons the Stranger again to become a spiritual leader of Britannian people by example. Throughout the game, the Stranger's actions determine how close he comes to the ideal. Upon achieving enlightenment in every Virtue, he can reach the Codex of Ultimate Wisdom and becomes the \"Avatar\", the embodiment of Britannia's virtues.In Ultima V: Warriors of Destiny (1988), the Avatar returns to Britannia to find that after Lord British had been lost in the Underworld, Lord Blackthorn, who rules in his stead, was corrupted by the Shadowlords and enforces a radically twisted vision of the Virtues, deviating considerably from their original meaning. The Avatar and his companions proceed to rescue the true king, overthrow the tyrant and restore the Virtues in their true form.Ultima VI: The False Prophet (1990) details the invasion of Britannia by Gargoyles, which the Avatar and his companions have to repel. Over the course of the game it is revealed that the Gargoyles have valid reasons to loathe the Avatar. Exploring the themes of racism and xenophobia, the game tasks the Avatar with understanding and reconciling two seemingly opposing cultures.Ultima VII: The Black Gate (1992) sees the Avatar entangled in the plan of an ostensibly virtuous and benevolent organization named the Fellowship (inspired by Scientology)[2][3] to create a gateway for the evil entity known as the Guardian to enter Britannia. An expansion pack was released named Forge of Virtue that added a newly arisen volcanic island to the map that the Avatar was invited to investigate. The tie-in storyline was limited to this island, where a piece of Exodus (his data storage unit) had resurfaced. To leave the island again, the Avatar had to destroy this remnant of Exodus. In the process of doing so, he also created The Black Sword, an immensely powerful weapon possessed by a demon.Ultima VII Part Two: Serpent Isle (1993) was released as the second part of Ultima VII because it used the same game engine as Ultima VII. According to interviews, Richard Garriott felt it therefore did not warrant a new number. Production was rushed due to deadlines set to the developers, and the storyline was cut short; remains of the original, longer storyline can be found in the database. Following the Fellowship's defeat, its founder Batlin flees to the Serpent Isle, pursued by the Avatar and companions. Serpent Isle is revealed as another fragment of former Sosaria, and its history which is revealed throughout the game provides many explanations and ties up many loose ends left over from the Age of Darkness era. Magical storms herald the unraveling of the dying world's very fabric, and the game's mood is notably melancholic, including the voluntary sacrificial death of a long-standing companion of the Avatar. By the end of the game, the Avatar is abducted by the Guardian and thrown into another world, which becomes the setting for the next game in the series. The Silver Seed was an expansion pack for Ultima VII Part 2 where the Avatar travels back in time to plant a silver seed, thus balancing the forces that hold the Serpent Isle together. Like Forge of Virtue, the expansion contained an isolated sub-quest that was irrelevant to the main game's storyline, but provided the Avatar with a plethora of useful and powerful artifacts.In Ultima VIII: Pagan (1994), the Avatar finds himself exiled by the Guardian to a world called \"Pagan\". The Britannic Principles and Virtues are unknown here. Pagan is ruled by the Elemental Titans, god-like servants of the Guardian. The Avatar defeats them with their own magic, ascending to demi-godhood himself, and finally returns to Britannia. A planned expansion pack, The Lost Vale, was canceled after Ultima VIII failed to meet sales expectations.Ultima IX: Ascension (1999), the final installment of the series, sees Britannia conquered and its Virtues corrupted by the Guardian. The Avatar has to cleanse and restore them. The Guardian is revealed to be the evil part of the Avatar himself, expelled from him when he became the Avatar. To stop it, he has to merge with it, destroying himself as a separate entity. The unreleased version of the plot featured a more apocalyptic ending, with the Guardian and Lord British killed, Britannia destroyed, and the Avatar ascending to a higher plane of existence.Akalabeth: World of Doom was released in 1980, and is sometimes considered a prequel to the Ultima series.Sierra On-Line also produced Ultima: Escape from Mt. Drash in 1983. The maze game has little in common with the others,[4] but is highly sought after by collectors due to extreme rarity.The Worlds of Ultima series is a spin-off of Ultima VI using the same game engine, following the Avatar's adventures after the game's conclusion. In Worlds of Ultima: The Savage Empire (1990), a failed experiment transports the Avatar to the Valley of Eodon, a jungle world populated by thirteen primitive tribes whom he must unite against a common enemy, the insectoid Myrmidex. Ultima: Worlds of Adventure 2: Martian Dreams (1991) takes place after The Savage Empire and sees the Avatar travel back in time to the Victorian era and eventually land on Mars to rescue humans stranded on it by accident and to restore the native Martian civilization. The third game, Ultima: Worlds of Adventure 3: Arthurian Legends, was planned to be set in the times of King Arthur but was canceled in 1993.The second spin-off series, Ultima Underworld, consisted of two games. Set after Ultima VI, Ultima Underworld: The Stygian Abyss (1992) sees the Avatar descending into the Great Stygian Abyss to rescue a Britannian baron's kidnapped daughter and prevent the summoning of a powerful demon. Ultima Underworld II: Labyrinth of Worlds (1993) is set between the two parts of Ultima VII and starts with the Guardian trapping Lord British, the Avatar and his companions within an impenetrable barrier in their castle. To free them, the Avatar has to travel through several parallel universes looking for a way to undo the spell.A group of volunteer programmers created Ultima V: Lazarus in 2006, a remake of Ultima V using the Dungeon Siege engine.Console versions of Ultima have allowed further exposure to the series, especially in Japan where the games have been bestsellers and were accompanied by several tie-in products including Ultima manga. In most cases, gameplay and graphics have been changed significantly.Ultima Online (1997), a MMORPG spin-off of the main series, has become an unexpected hit, making it one of the earliest and longest-running successful MMORPGs of all time. Its lore retconned the ending of Ultima I, stating that when the Stranger shattered the Gem of Immortality, he discovered that it was tied to the world itself, therefore its shards each contained a miniature version of Britannia. The player characters in Ultima Online exist on these \"shards\". Eight expansion packs for UO have been released (The Second Age, Renaissance, Third Dawn, Lord Blackthorn's Revenge, Age of Shadows, Samurai Empire, Mondain's Legacy and Stygian Abyss) . The aging UO graphic engine was renewed in 2007 with the official Kingdom Reborn client. Ultima Online 2, later renamed to Ultima Worlds Online: Origin and canceled in 2001, would have introduced steampunk elements to the game world, following Lord British's unsuccessful attempt to merge past, present, and future shards together.UO spawned two sequel efforts that were canceled before release: Ultima Worlds Online: Origin (canceled in 2001, though the game's storyline was published in the Technocrat War trilogy.) and Ultima X: Odyssey (canceled in 2004). Ultima X: Odyssey (2004) would have continued the story of Ultima IX. Now merged with the Guardian, the Avatar creates a world of Alucinor inside his mind, where the players were supposed to pursue the Eight Virtues in order to strengthen him and weaken the Guardian. Ultima X was developed without participation of the original creator Richard Garriott and he no longer owns the rights to the series. However, he still owns the rights to several of the game characters so it is impossible for either him or Electronic Arts to produce a new Ultima title without getting permission from each other.Lord of Ultima is a free-to-play browser-based MMORTS released in 2010 by EA Phenomic. It is the first release in the Ultima series since Ultima Online, and also the first title to have no involvement from series creator Garriott or founding company Origin. It has been criticized[by whom?] for having slow-paced gameplay and very weak connections to the Ultima franchise lore. EA has announced that Lord of Ultima will be shut down and taken offline as of May 12, 2014.[needs update]Announced in summer 2012, Ultima Forever is a free-to-play online action role-playing game. In contrast to Lord of Ultima, Ultima Forever returns to the lore of the original game series.Several novels were released under the Ultima name, including:In Japan, an Ultima soundtrack CD, two kinds of wrist watches, a tape dispenser, a pencil holder, a board game, a jacket, and a beach towel were released. There was also an Ultima anime cartoon.[8]Three manga comics were released in Japan:Ultima game boxes often contained so-called \"feelies\"; e.g. from Ultima II on, every game in the main series came with a cloth map of the game world. Starting with Ultima IV, small trinkets like pendants, coins and magic stones were found in the boxes. Made of metal or glass, they usually represented an important object also found within the game itself.Not liking how games were sold in zip lock bags with a few pages printed out for instructions, Richard Garriott insisted Ultima II be sold in a box, with a cloth map, and a manual.[9][10] Sierra was the only company at that time willing to agree to this, and thus he signed with them.In the Atari 8bit version of Ultima IV one of the floppy disks had an unformatted track. In its absence the player would lose on every fight, which would not be obvious as a copy protection effect right away as one could assume that this was just due to either lack of experience or proper equipment. The protection mechanism was subtle enough to be overlooked by the German distributor which originally delivered Atari 8bit packages with floppies that were formatted regularly, and thus these paid copies acted like pirated copies, causing players to lose every battle.[11]In Ultima V, there were one or two instances where ostensibly insignificant information found in the accompanying booklet were asked by person(s) encountered in the game. The game also used runic script in some places and a special language for spell names, for both of which the necessary translation tables / explanations were provided in the booklet. These can be seen as subtle copy-protection measures, well fitted for the context of history and fantasy so that a casual player didn't take them for copy protection.[12]Ultima VI introduced a more systematic use of copy protection in the form of in-game questions, preventing the player from progressing any further if the questions were answered incorrectly.[13] In Ultima VII, this practice was continued, although in both games the player had an unlimited number of tries to answer the questions correctly. Answers could be obtained by consulting the manual or cloth map, although the manual released with the Ultima Collection contained all copy protection answers for every game.[14]In Ultima VII Part 2: Serpent Isle, the copy protection was changed slightly. Players were asked questions at two points in the game, and if they could not answer after two attempts, all NPCs said nothing but altered versions of famous quotes, such as \"My kingdom for a hammer!\", \"Honor thy father and thy hoe, babycakes\" and \"Oh my, twig, I don't think we're in Britannia anymore\". Everything would also be labeled \"Oink!\", preventing the game from being playable. From Ultima VIII onward, copy protection questions were discontinued.[15]Originally, the world of Ultima was made up of four continents. These were Lord British's Realm, ruled by Lord British and the Lost King; The Lands of Danger and Despair, ruled by Lord Shamino and the King of the White Dragon; The Lands of the Dark Unknown, ruled by Lord Olympus and the King of the Black Dragon; and The Lands of the Feudal Lords, ruled by the lords of Castle Rondorin and Castle Barataria.After the defeat of Mondain and the shattering of his Gem of Immortality in Ultima I, there was a cataclysm that changed the structure of the world. Three of the four continents seemingly disappeared, leaving only Lord British's realm in the world. This remaining continent was referred from then on as \"Sosaria\". The Lands of Danger and Despair were later rediscovered as the Serpent Isle, which had been moved to a different dimension or plane, so it seems likely that the other two continents still exist. Ultima II shows Castle Barataria on Planet X, suggesting that the Lands of the Feudal Lords became this planet; Ultima Online: Samurai Empire posits that the Lands of the Feudal Lords was transformed into the Tokuno Islands by the cataclysm.After the defeat of Exodus in Ultima III, Sosaria became Britannia in order to honor its ruler, Lord British. Serpent Isle remained connected with Britannia via a gate in the polar region. The Fellowship leader, Batlin, fled here after the Black Gate was destroyed in Ultima VII, preventing the Guardian's first invasion. Ninety percent of the island's population was destroyed by evil Banes released by Batlin in a foolish attempt to capture them for his own use in Ultima VII Part 2.In Ultima, the player takes the role of the Avatar, who embodies eight virtues. First introduced in Ultima IV, the Three Principles and the Eight Virtues marked a reinvention of the game focus from a traditional role-playing model into an ethically framed one.[17] Each virtue is associated with a party member, one of Britannia's cities, and one of the eight other planets in Britannia's solar system. Each virtue also has a mantra and each principle a word of power that the player must learn. The Eight Virtues explored in Ultima are Honesty, Compassion, Valor, Justice, Sacrifice, Honor, Spirituality, and Humility. These Eight Virtues are based on the Three Principles of Truth, Love, and Courage. The Principles are derived from the One True Axiom, the combination of all Truth, all Love, and all Courage, which is Infinity.[17][18]The virtues were first introduced in Ultima IV: Quest of the Avatar (1985), where the goal of the game is to practice them and become a moral exemplar. Virtues and their variations are present in all later installments. Richard Garriott's motives in designing the virtue system were to build on the fact that games were provoking thought in the player, even unintentionally. As a designer, he \"wasn't interested in teaching any specific lesson; instead, his next game would be about making people think about the consequences of their actions.\"[19] The original virtue system in Ultima was partially inspired by the 16 ways of purification which lead to Avatarhood in Hinduism.[17][20] He also drew on his interpretation of characters from The Wizard of Oz, with the Scarecrow representing truth, the Tin Woodsman representing love, and the Cowardly Lion representing courage.[21]The Virtues have become a frequent theme in the Ultima games following Ultima IV, with many different variants used throughout the series.[22] Ultima V: Warriors of Destiny saw Lord Blackthorn turn the virtue system into a rigid and draconian set of laws. The rigid system of Blackthorn unintentionally causes the Virtues to actually achieve their polar opposites, in part due to the influence of the Shadowlords. This shows that the Virtues always come from one's own self, and that codifying ethics into law does not automatically make evil people good.[17] Ultima VI: The False Prophet confronted the Avatar with the fact that, from another point of view, the Avatar's quests for Virtue may not appear virtuous at all, presenting an alternative set of virtues.[23] In Ultima VII, an order known as the Fellowship displaced the Virtues with its own seemingly benevolent belief system, casting Britannia into disarray; and in Ultima IX, the Virtues had been inverted into their opposite anti-virtues.Ultima's virtue system was considered a new frontier in game design,[24] and has become \"an industry standard, especially within role-playing games.\"[25] The original system from Ultima IV has influenced moral systems in games such as Black & White, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic and the Fable series.[25][26] However, Ultima can only be won by being virtuous, while other games typically offer a choice to be vicious.[26] Mark Hayse specifically praises Ultima's virtue system for its subtlety. The game emphasizes the importance of virtue, but leaves the practice ambiguous with no explicit point values and limited guidance. This makes the virtue system more of a \"philosophical journey\" than an ordinary game puzzle.[25]The Ultima series of computer games employed several different artificial scripts. The people of Britannia, the fantasy world where the games are set, speak English, and most of the day-to-day things are written in Latin alphabet. However, there still are other scripts, which are used by tradition.Britannian runes are the most commonly seen script. In many of the games of the series, most of the signs are written in runes, with no actual transcription for them given. The runes are based on Germanic runes, but are slightly different. They are very reminiscent of the Dwarven runes in Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, which Ultima creator Richard Garriott has stated he has read. The runes have been used since the early games. They gained steadier use in the games proper since Ultima V, which was the first game in series to feature a runic font and use it for most of the display of various signs. Earlier games featured runes only in other graphics; for example, in Ultima IV, visions from meditating use runic letters. The runes are used less in Ultima VII and in later games.Gargish is the language of the gargoyles of Britannia and the language used in spellcasting within the game. The language is complex and flexible, but the vocabulary is prohibitively small, limiting its use. The Gargish language has its own alphabet, although it can also be written in the Latin alphabet. The difference between nouns, verbs, and adjectives is expressed through intonations and gestures. Because of this, written Gargish uses suffixes to denote part of speech, grammatical tense, and grammatical aspect. In some cases, these suffixes are also used as independent words. Gargoyles avoid using pronouns or verb tense unless it is crucial to comprehension; therefore the language is often spoken in the infinitive (e.g., \"To say hello\"). The Gargish alphabet is featured in Ultima VI, though it is seen in the games very rarely. Ultima VII and onward does not feature anything written in the alphabet, with the sole exception of some books to be found in the gargoyle colony in the underwater city of Ambrosia in Ultima IX. The Gargish language and alphabet were designed by Herman Miller.The Ophidian alphabet, featured in Ultima VII Part Two: Serpent Isle, was used by the ophidian civilization that inhabited the Serpent Isle. It is based on various snake forms. Ophidian lettering was quite difficult to read, so the game included a Translation spell that made the letters look like Latin letters.In 1996, Next Generation ranked the Ultima series as collectively the 55th top game of all time, commenting that \"while the graphics and playing style change with the technological leaps of the day, [it] has been the most consistent source roleplaying excitment in history.\"[27] In 2000, Britannia was included in GameSpot's list of the ten best game worlds, called \"the oldest and one of the most historically rich gameworlds.\"[28]Many innovations of the early Ultimas - in particular Ultima III: Exodus (1983) - eventually became standard among later RPGs, such as the use of tiled graphics and party-based combat, its mix of fantasy and science-fiction elements, and the introduction of time travel as a plot device.[29] In turn, some of these elements were inspired by Wizardry, specifically the party-based combat.[30] Exodus was also revolutionary in its use of a written narrative to convey a larger story than the typically minimal plots that were common at the time. Most video games - including Garriott's own Ultima I and II and Akalabeth - tended to focus primarily on things like combat without venturing much further.[31] In addition, Garriott would introduce in Ultima IV a theme that would persist throughout later Ultimas - a system of chivalry and code of conduct in which the player, or \"Avatar\", is tested periodically (in both obvious and unseen ways) and judged according to his or her actions. This system of morals and ethics was unique, in that in other video games players could for the most part act and do as they wished without having to consider the consequences of their actions.[31]Ultima III would go on to be released for many other platforms and influence the development of such RPGs as Excalibur and Dragon Quest;[32] and many consider the game to be the first modern CRPG.[29]Richard Garriott's new company Portalarium is developing an MMORPG that Garriott has described as a clear spiritual successor of the Ultima series.[33] On March 8, 2013, Portalarium launched a Kickstarter campaign[34] for Shroud of the Avatar: Forsaken Virtues.[35] Forsaken Virtues is the first of five full-length episodic installments in Shroud of the Avatar. Estimated availability of Forsaken Virtues, is October 2014, with Episodes 2 through 5 estimated for subsequent yearly releases. Ultima Online project director Starr Long has joined Portalarium as executive producer for Shroud of the Avatar.[36]","title":"","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/98/Ultima_Logo.png/256px-Ultima_Logo.png","developer":"","genre":""},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultima_VI:_The_False_Prophet","description":"Ultima VI: The False Prophet, released by Origin Systems in 1990, is the sixth part in the role-playing video game series of Ultima.

The first trilogy only allowed simple interaction while the second trilogy used a keyword-based dialogue. Ultima VII retains the old keywords themselves, but uses a dialogue tree where dialogue options are picked with a mouse rather than entered on keyboard; previously, the players had to learn a keyword from other dialogues, which allowed the player, if so desired, to find out the keyword from other sources (such as walkthroughs). Now, the keywords only appear when they are actually learned beforehand in the game due to the plot. (For example, \"thief caught\" dialogue option won't actually appear until a thief is actually caught.) The game also features a lot more dialogue than the previous parts; most of the characters have extensive dialogues.Computer Gaming World '​s Scorpia in 1992 praised Ultima VII: The Black Gate '​s \"first-class\" graphics, sound, and realism, called the story \"engrossing\", and liked the mouse- and keyboard-based user interface, but criticized the slow performance (\"I estimate that the slow speed of the game added about a week to my playing time\"), several serious bugs, and combat (\"one of the least fun aspects of the game\"). She concluded that the game gives \"me very mixed feelings ... Getting through this Ultima will require a certain amount of patience and forebearance\".[10] Charles Ardai acknowledged the \"negative word-of- mouth in some gaming circles\" and stated that \"Computer gaming needs another visit to good old Britannia like the movies need another visit from Freddy Krueger\". He was nonetheless much more positive in his review for the magazine, writing that \"Ultima VII is not more of the same. It is daring and unusual, has a sophisticated interface and story, takes full advantage of both its own history and the conventions of the genre, and manages to be at once grounded and unpredictable\". Ardai praised the plot as the best in the series, stating that \"As the best fantasy is, Ultima VII is an allegory for problems in the real world\", and concluded that the game \"will be a hard act to follow\".[11] The magazine named it one of 1992's best role-playing games.[12] Ultima VII: The Black Gate and Forge of Virtue were reviewed in 1993 in Dragon #191 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in \"The Role of Computers\" column. The reviewers gave the game 4 out of 5 stars.[13]","title":"Ultima VII: The Black Gate","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b3/Ultima_VII_Black_Gate_box.jpg/242px-Ultima_VII_Black_Gate_box.jpg","developer":"Origin Systems","genre":"Role-playing game"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighter","description":"Ultimate Fighter - known in Japan as Hiryū no Ken S: Golden Fighter (飛龍の拳スペシャル ゴールデンファイター?),[3][4] is a 1992 fighting video game developed and published by Culture Brain for the Super NES.","title":"Ultimate Fighter","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/24/Ultimate-fighter-na.jpg/220px-Ultimate-fighter-na.jpg","developer":"Culture Brain","genre":"2D fighting"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Mortal_Kombat_3","description":"Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 (UMK3) is a fighting game in the Mortal Kombat series, originally developed and released by Midway Games to arcades in 1995. It is an update of 1995's earlier Mortal Kombat 3 (MK3) with an altered gameplay system, additional characters and stages, and some new features.Several ninja characters absent from Mortal Kombat 3 return in Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, including Kitana, Jade, Reptile and Scorpion on the prototype version; a new Ultimate Kombat Code was added in revision 1.0 to enable Mileena, Ermac and Classic Sub-Zero as secret characters. Two new gameplay modes were introduced: the 2-on-2 mode which was similar to an Endurance match but with human players on both sides, and a new eight-player Tournament mode.Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 Wave Net was a rare network version of the game that allowed for online multiplayer matches. It was tested only in the Chicago and San Francisco areas that used a dedicated T1 line, connected directly to Midway's Chicago headquarters; many people outside the test area were not aware of its existence during its release. One store kept the T1 line installed after the test concluded, but eventually removed the Wave Net game in favor of a Golden Tee game that uses a dial-up connection. It is highly unlikely that any Wave Net test games were ever released to the public after the infrastructure was dismantled, and so there are no known ROM image dumps of this version. One of the reasons this version was not widely adopted was the rarity and cost of T1 lines at the time. The game was released before alternative broadband access was available. At the time, a T1 was the only guaranteed way to get broadband into an arcade, but the game did not utilize the full bandwidth of the T1. Midway subsidized the cost of the line during the tests to make it more attractive to the arcade owners.[citation needed]Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 was later released for a variety of home systems, including stationary (SNES, Sega Genesis and Sega Saturn) and portable consoles (Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS), the Xbox Live Arcade, and iOS-based mobile devices and mobile phones. The game was also bundled with Mortal Kombat: Armageddon for the PlayStation 2 and included in compilation release Mortal Kombat Arcade Kollection for the PC, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. The developers and publishers of the various releases included Acclaim Entertainment, Avalanche Software, Electronic Arts, Eurocom, Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment, and Williams Entertainment. The later versions usually feature online play and other improvements over the arcade version, and in some cases even 3D graphics.Critical reception of the game has varied depending on the version under review. Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the Saturn version an 8.625 and named it their \"Game of the Month\", commenting that it is a \"near-perfect\" translation of the arcade version, with the only problem being the long load times.[19] VideoGames rated the Sega Saturn port a review score of 8/10, calling it \"simply a great game\" and stating that \"if there was ever a definitive MK game, this is it.\"[20] Sega Saturn Magazine rated it 91%. Like Electronic Gaming Monthly, they praised the game's retention of the full content and quality of the arcade version, but also added, \"Capcom have just released three bona fide awesome 2D beat 'em ups onto the Saturn, and ... I couldn't honestly say that I rate MK3 above them.\"[21] A review by Computer and Video Games gave this \"excellent conversion of a great coin-op\" a rating of four out of five, calling it \"[e]ssential for fans, and something well worth consideration from all Saturn owners.\"[22] The SNES version was nominated for Nintendo Power Awards '96 in the category \"Best Tournament Fighting Game\".[23] GameSpot's \"Best and Worst of 2006\" included the XBLA version among the five best fighting game of the year.[24] Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 was named as the best retro Mortal Kombat game by Alex Langley of Arcade Sushi in 2013.[25]Mortal Kombat Trilogy (MKT) was released by Midway in 1996 as a follow-up to Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3. Unlike UMK3, Trilogy was not released in arcades but was instead released for the Sony PlayStation, Nintendo 64, Sega Saturn and PC, as well as for the Game.com and R-Zone. Trilogy features the same gameplay and story, but adds several completely new characters and introduces new features such the \"Aggressor\" bar, a meter that fills during the course of the match to make a player character faster and stronger for a short time, and the Brutality finishing moves that were introduced in the 16-bit versions of UMK3.","title":"Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f9/Ultimate_MK3.png","developer":"Midway Games","genre":"Fighting game"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraman:_Towards_the_Future_(video_game)","description":"Ultraman: Towards the Future (ウルトラマン, Urutoraman?, \"Ultraman\")[5] is a multi-platform fighting game based on the contemporary Ultra Series, Ultraman: Towards the Future.

The game focuses on fast moving action, and was released to show that the SNES could handle games similar to SEGA's popular Sonic games.[citation needed]The gameplay of Uniracers involves racing riderless unicycles around a 2D track. Heavy emphasis is placed on performing stunts. Performing stunts causes the unicycle to go faster on race or circuit tracks and earn points on stunt tracks. The stunts that can be performed are relatively simple, mostly only involving jumping in the air and rotating about a given axis in 3D space. The idea is to be able to perform these stunts quickly in tight situations while landing the unicycle on its wheel to avoid wiping out, which results in the loss of accumulated speed. If a long series of stunts are completed before landing you can receive a message saying,\"Dude!\", \"Flower Power!\", or something similar.Uniracers was known by the working title \"1x1\" during development. Shortly after the game's release, DMA Design was sued by Pixar for allegedly copying the unicycle design and concept from their 1987 short film Red's Dream. Mike Dailly, one of the developers at DMA Design, commented, \"The problem with Pixar was that they seemed to think that any computer generated unicycle was owned by them.\" DMA Design lost the lawsuit, and as a result, Nintendo had to terminate production of further Unirally cartridges. According to Dailly, \"The deal was that Nintendo wouldn't make any more carts so Unirally only sold the 300k initial run\".[2] Uniracers has gotten a cult following, and is considered to be an underrated classic on the SNES.","title":"Uniracers","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/0f/Uniracers_boxart.png/220px-Uniracers_boxart.png","developer":"DMA Design","genre":"Racing"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Untouchables_(film)#Video_game","description":"The Untouchables is a 1987 American crime drama film directed by Brian De Palma and written by David Mamet. Based on the book The Untouchables, the film stars Kevin Costner as government agent Eliot Ness. It also stars Robert De Niro as gang leader Al Capone and Sean Connery as Irish-American officer Jimmy Malone (based on the real life agent and member of the \"Untouchables\" Irish-American Marty Lahart). The film follows Ness' autobiographical account of the efforts of him and his Untouchables to bring Capone to justice during Prohibition. The Grammy Award-winning score was composed by Ennio Morricone.The Untouchables was released on June 3, 1987, and received positive reviews. Observers praised the film for its approach, as well as its direction. The film was also a financial success, grossing $76 million domestically. The Untouchables was nominated for four Academy Awards, of which Connery received one for Best Supporting Actor.[2]During Prohibition, Al Capone (De Niro) has nearly the whole city of Chicago under his control and supplies illegal liquor. Bureau of Prohibition agent Eliot Ness (Costner), summoned to stop Capone, conducts raids using a large squad of officers. After his efforts fail due to corrupt policemen tipping off Capone, he has a chance meeting with incorruptible Irish-American veteran officer Jim Malone (Connery). Knowing of the system's rampant corruption and appreciating Ness's efforts to bring Capone down, Malone decides to work with Ness. To combat corruption, Malone suggests that they enlist men from the police academy who have not yet come under Capone's influence. They recruit Italian-American trainee George Stone (Andy García) for his superior marksmanship and intelligence, and accountant Oscar Wallace (Charles Martin Smith), assigned to Ness from Washington, D.C., forming a small team that is soon dubbed by the press as \"The Untouchables\".Wallace informs Ness that Capone has not filed an income tax return in four years; therefore, they can try Capone for tax evasion if nothing else. Ness is visited by an alderman who tries to bribe him into dropping the investigation but Ness throws him out. When Capone henchman Frank Nitti (Billy Drago) threatens his family, Ness has them moved to a safer place and then takes the team to the Canada – United States border for a raid on a liquor shipment. Ness chases one of the gangsters into an empty house and kills him in self-defense. Malone captures George (Brad Sullivan), a Capone bookkeeper, and brings him back to the house for interrogation. As George proves uncooperative, Malone grabs the dead man and shoots him to coerce George into cooperating, much to the dismay of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police who have assisted in the raid.While Wallace takes George into protective custody, Nitti infiltrates the police station, killing Wallace and wounding George in the service elevator; then writes \"touchable\" on the wall with blood. Ness angrily confronts Capone and his men, but Malone intervenes, as Capone mocks Ness over the death of his friend. Malone persuades Ness to stall the district attorney (Clifton James) from dropping the case, then corners police chief Mike Dorsett, who sold out Wallace to Capone. Malone learns about another Capone accountant, Walter Payne, and calls Ness with the news. A knife-wielding thug breaks into Malone’s home; Malone forces him out of the backdoor with a shotgun, only to step into a Tommy gun ambush by Nitti. He lives long enough for Ness and Stone to find him, and advise which train Payne will take out of town before he dies.Ness and Stone arrive at Union Station and find Payne guarded by several gangsters. After the fierce and epic shootout, the two succeed in killing the gangsters and taking Payne alive. He testifies in court about how untaxed cash flowed throughout Capone's organization. Ness notices that Capone seems unperturbed despite the probability of serving a long prison sentence, and also sees Nitti carrying a gun inside his jacket. He escorts Nitti out of the courtroom with the bailiff and discovers that Nitti has the mayor’s permission to carry the weapon. Ness identifies Nitti as Malone’s assassin after seeing Malone's address in Nitti's matchbook.Nitti shoots the bailiff in a panic and flees to the roof of the courthouse, but Ness corners him. After fighting down his urge to take revenge for Malone, Ness plans to deliver Nitti to the authorities; but when Nitti insults the memory of Malone while also saying that he will never go to prison, Ness angrily pushes him off the roof. In the courtroom, Stone shows Ness a document from Nitti’s jacket that reveals that the jury was bribed, explaining Capone's relaxed mood. The judge has no intention of using it as evidence until Ness bluffs that the judge's name is in Payne’s ledger of payoffs. The judge decides to switch juries with a neighboring courtroom and restart the trial. Upon hearing the judge's order to the bailiff to have the juries switched, Capone immediately realizes what has happened and, contrary to his earlier bored, relaxed mood, becomes angry with his lawyer, telling him to \"do something over here.\" The lawyer, presumably realizing that a fair trial will almost certainly result in Capone's conviction and attempting to mitigate the outcome, proceeds to announce to the judge - without Capone's consent - that they have decided to withdraw the plea of \"not guilty,\" and enter a plea of \"guilty.\" Shocked and infuriated, Capone flies into a hysterical rage, railing furiously first at the judge, and then at Ness, shouting angrily over and over again that he (Ness) is \"nothing but a lot of talk and a badge.\" As the scene ends, Capone has utterly lost his cool, and is seen being dragged from the courtroom, screaming at Ness and struggling to get free of the courtroom bailiffs. In a following scene, back in his office some time later, Ness is seen clipping newspaper headlines announcing first Capone's conviction, and then his eleven-year prison sentence.Packing up his Chicago office, Ness ponders the Saint Jude pendant that Malone had carried with him for many years, and which Malone had given to him before dying. He gives the pendant to Stone, reasoning that Malone would have wanted a cop to have it. When a reporter mentions that Prohibition is due to be repealed and asks Ness what he might do then, Ness responds, \"I think I’ll have a drink.\"De Niro wanted one extra scene written for his character, and time to finish his commitment to the Broadway production of Cuba and His Teddy Bear and to gain about 30 pounds (14 kg) to play Capone; according to De Palma, De Niro was \"very concerned about the shape of his face for the part.\"[1] The Untouchables began production in Chicago on August 18, 1986.[3] Actual historical Chicago locations were featured in the movie.[4]A month after the film was released, De Palma downplayed his role on the film:Being a writer myself, I don't like to take credit for things I didn't do. I didn't develop this script. David [Mamet] used some of my ideas and he didn't use some of them. I looked upon it more clinically, as a piece of material that has to be shaped, with certain scenes here or there. But as for the moral dimension, that's more or less the conception of the script, and I just implemented it with my skills – which are well developed. It's good to walk in somebody else's shoes for a while. You get out of your own obsessions; you are in the service of somebody else's vision, and that's a great discipline for a director.[5]De Palma met with Bob Hoskins to discuss the role in case De Niro, the director's first choice for the part, turned it down. When De Niro took the part, De Palma mailed Hoskins a check for £20,000 with a \"Thank You\" note, which prompted Hoskins to call up De Palma and ask him if there were any more movies he didn't want him to be in.[6]The Untouchables opened on June 3, 1987 in 1,012 theatres where it grossed $10,023,094 on its opening weekend and ranked the sixth-highest opening weekend of 1987. It went on to make $76.2 million in North America.[7] According to producer Art Linson, the polls conducted for the film showed that approximately 50% of the audience was women. \"Ordinarily, a violent film attracts predominantly men, but this is also touching, about redemption and relationships and because of that the audience tends to forgive the excesses when it comes to violence\".[8]The Untouchables received positive reviews from film critics and has an 81% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Vincent Canby, of The New York Times, gave the film a positive review, calling it \"a smashing work\" and saying it was \"vulgar, violent, funny and sometimes breathtakingly beautiful\".[9] Conversely, Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times praised the film for its action sequences and locations but disapproved of David Mamet's script and Brian De Palma's direction.[10] Hal Hinson, in his review for the Washington Post, also criticized De Palma's direction: \"And somehow we're put off here by the spectacular stuff he throws up onto the screen. De Palma's storytelling instincts have given way completely to his interest in film as a visual medium. His only real concern is his own style\".[11] Time magazine's Richard Schickel wrote, \"Mamet's elegantly efficient script does not waste a word, and De Palma does not waste a shot. The result is a densely layered work moving with confident, compulsive energy\".[12]Ebert singled out De Niro's scenes portraying Al Capone as the biggest disappointment of the film, while giving praise to Sean Connery's work. While he was voted first place in an Empire magazine historical poll for worst film accent,[13] Connery was awarded the Academy Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role for his performance. Pauline Kael called it \"a great audience movie – a wonderful potboiler.\" Time magazine ranked it as one of the best films of 1987.[14]A side-scrolling video game was released by Ocean Software in 1989 on ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64, MSX, Amiga, DOS, and later on NES and SNES. Based loosely on the movie, the game plays out some of the more significant parts of the film. Set in Chicago, the primary goal of the game is to take down Al Capone's henchmen and eventually detain Capone.Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the Super NES version a 5.8 out of 10, commenting that \"This title would have been better if it were Super Scope compatible, for it is a bit difficult to use the pad during the shooting sequences.\"[20]","title":"","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/92/UntouchablesThe.jpg/220px-UntouchablesThe.jpg","developer":"","genre":""},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_Strike","description":"Urban Strike is a video game developed and published by Electronic Arts.

In addition, the player must defend their own fortress from Smoker attacks.Waterworld is widely regarded as the worst Virtual Boy game out of the 22 games released in its short life.

As in other fighting games, Weaponlord has players select a character and defeat a series of opponents. The game is a weapons-based fighter, with various gory moves and a deep counterattack system.Weaponlord's fighters possess between 9 and 12 special moves each. Moves can be executed one of several ways: sweeping motions on the directional pad followed by an attack button, \"charge\" moves where a directional button is held for 2 seconds quickly followed by the opposite direction, and finally an attack button, or hold down moves where the player must first hold down an attack button, followed by a directional motion, and finish it by releasing said attack button.The game's lead designers James Goddard and Dave Winstead had previously worked for Capcom. Goddard designed the character Dee Jay for Super Street Fighter II and Winstead had worked on Super Street Fighter II Turbo. Both had extensive fighting game tournament experience and wanted to cater to dedicated fans of the genre with Weaponlord. They also wanted to optimize the game for the slow dial-up connections of the XBAND service, timing parry animations and character turnaround time to account for lag.[1]Zarak was the only character in the game to feature his own signature fatality, although rumors persist that other character have unique finishing moves as well. It was originally intended[citation needed] for all of the characters to have a unique death combo but due to the apparent rush to get Weaponlord out the door, only Zarak's was completed.Both Jenn-Tai and Zorn's endings allude to a more powerful entity at large, with Zorn's Demon Shield being the imprisoned spirit of said evil. This was intended to lead into Weaponlord 2, which never came to be.Allgame offered praise for the deep countering system, but said that the complexity of the game may turn off newcomers. Reviewer Scott Alan Marriott said it was not easy to pick up and play like Mortal Kombat and that Weaponlord was \"designed for the hardcore fan rather than those new to the genre\". In addition, he mentioned that game's computer opponents were far too difficult for novices. Marriott also wrote that the game's detailed character design was distracting and that the animations were choppy, as well faulting the game for having fewer playable characters than the Street Fighter II series. Despite these flaws, he recommended it as \"a must-have title for the fighting game enthusiast\".[3]Weaponlord was not a large commercial success. James Goddard attributed this partly to it being released at the tail end of the 16-bit console era.[1]Namco informed the developers that they would not be working on a sequel to Weaponlord. The game's weapon and parry mechanics was shown to Namco; Goddard and Winstead believe that the gameplay became the basis for Soul Edge/Calibur games.[1]James Goddard has remained in the gaming industry and worked on recent titles such as the reboot of Killer Instinct.[4] As far back as 2008 and as recently as 2014, Goddard has expressed interest in reviving the Weaponlord franchise for current generation consoles. He has his own small development studio but stated that there is currently no budget to produce a proper Weaponlord game.[4]","title":"Weaponlord","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/30/WeaponlordSNES_boxart.JPG/220px-WeaponlordSNES_boxart.JPG","developer":"Visual Concepts","genre":"Fighting"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We%27re_Back!_A_Dinosaur%27s_Story_(film)#Promotion","description":"We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story is a 1993 American animated science fiction adventure film, produced by Steven Spielberg's Amblimation animation studio, distributed by Universal Pictures, and originally released to theaters on November 24, 1993 for the United States. Starring the voice talents of John Goodman, Rhea Perlman, Jay Leno, Walter Cronkite, Julia Child, and Martin Short. It was based on the 1987 Hudson Talbott children's book of the same name, which was narrated from the perspective of the main character, a Tyrannosaurus rex named Rex.The film opens with a trio of young bluebirds harassing their youngest sibling, Buster (Blaze Berdahl). As Buster leaves his family, he meets an intelligent Tyrannosaurus Rex named Rex (John Goodman) playing golf. He explains to Buster that he was once a ravaging dinosaur, and proceeds to tell the story of how he came to become what he is today.65 million years in the past in the Cretaceous Montana, Rex was a savage and frightening creature who terrorized smaller dinosaurs. As he is seen chasing a Thescelosaurus, his rampage is interrupted when a futuristic aircraft arrives, and he is then greeted by a small green alien-like creature named Vorb (Jay Leno) who lures him into the craft and force feeds him \"Brain Grain\", a cereal that increases a creature's intelligence. Rex is given his name and introduced to other dinosaurs that have been fed Brain Grain: Dweeb the green Parasaurolophus (Charles Fleischer), Woog the blue Triceratops (Rene LeVant) and Elsa the purple Pterodactyl (Felicity Kendal), who develops an immediate crush on Rex. Later, they meet Captain Neweyes (Walter Cronkite), the inventor of the cereal and pilot of the aircraft, who then reveals his goal of allowing the children of the present time to see real dinosaurs, fulfilling their biggest wishes. He informs them that there are two people to watch for: Dr. Juliet Bleeb (Julia Child), a scientist from the Museum of Natural History who will aid the dinosaurs, and Professor Screweyes (Kenneth Mars), Neweyes' insane brother. He instructs them to find Bleeb and avoid Screweyes.Neweyes drops the dinosaurs off at the East River in 1993, where they meet a young boy named Louie (Joey Shea), who plans on running away to join the circus. Upon reaching New York City, Louie realizes that the citizens would panic if they saw live dinosaurs and, with the help of Elsa, flies over the city in search of a good hiding place. During the flight, Louie comes across a girl named Cecilia (Yeardley Smith), who was crying; she explains that her parents are hardly around (saying that her father is into business, and her mother is more of a socialite). Louie convinces Cecilia to abandon her home and introduces her to the dinosaurs (Louie and Cecilia then quickly develop an infatuation for each other).When the dinosaurs explain their goal of getting to the Museum of Natural History, Louie decides to disguise them as floats in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. During the parade, Rex hears all the children wishing to see real dinosaurs, so he starts to sing \"Roll Back the Rock (To the Dawn of Time)\" (the movie's theme song). When he sees the Apatosaurus balloon coming out in the parade however, Rex mistakes it for being real and hand shakes it too tight with his claws, causing its air sealer to pop open. The balloon runs out of air and falls on the dinosaurs, who are otherwise unharmed. When the audience realizes that live dinosaurs are among them, they fly into a panic. The local authorities are called in to stop the dinosaurs, resulting in a slapstick-filled chase scene.As the dinosaurs lose the police, Louie and Cecilia venture to Central Park, where Professor Screweyes is running his \"Eccentric Circus\". They meet Professor Screweyes and cite their desire to join his circus. As they sign a contract, the dinosaurs arrive and try to save them. Screweyes, upon meeting the dinosaurs, explains that he delights in scaring people and believes that the dinosaurs would make a great addition to his circus. He then reveals his very own \"Brain Drain\", pills that are the polar opposite of his brother's Brain Grain. He demonstrates the Brain Drain on the two children, devolving them into chimpanzees; however, he makes the dinosaurs a deal: if the dinosaurs consume the pills and join his circus, he'd destroy the contract and release Louie and Cecilia; reluctantly and sadly, the dinosaurs accept the offer.Believing that his friendship with Louie and Cecilia will be lost, Rex, reverting them back to their human selves (and thus wearing off the effects of the Brain Drain), tells the two to remember him.As the kids awake the next morning, they are greeted by a circus clown named Stubbs (Martin Short). Upon seeing the dinosaurs returned to their natural vicious states, Louie and Cecilia, with the help of Stubbs, plan to sneak into the night's show and save the dinosaurs. Professor Screweyes claims he can control the now-wild Rex, which he succeeds in doing by hypnotizing him. Everyone watching the show gets frightened during the performance, and many run away. After a crow turns on a highlight, causing the hypnotic effect to end. Rex realizes he has been tricked, becomes enraged and tries to attack Screweyes. However, Louie steps in and desperately tells the devolved Rex that killing Screweyes would be worse than what was happening right this moment. These impassioned pleas serve to return the dinosaurs to their friendly natures. Just then, Captain Neweyes arrives in his aircraft and congratulates Louie and Cecilia, who proceed to kiss in front of a whole crowd of people; simultaneously, Elsa tells Rex her true feelings towards him, possibly sparking a relationship between the two. After Stubbs arrives to resign from Professor Screweyes's employ (which includes him giving him back most of his belongings, with comedic results), Captain Neweyes, Louie, Cecilia and the dinosaurs board the aircraft, leaving Screweyes to be devoured by the crows (who have been present throughout the movie).The dinosaurs spend the rest of their days in the Museum of Natural History, allowing children to see live dinosaurs, fulfilling their wishes. Meanwhile, Louie and Cecilia reconcile with their respective parents, and the two become a couple. Rex returns Buster to his family before returning to the Museum of National History, humming the movie's theme song to himself.Production and development on We're Back: A Dinosaur's Story began at Universal Studios in Universal City near Los Angeles, California and Amblimation in London, United Kingdom in May 1989, which is at the time An American Tail: Fievel Goes West (1991) was also in production. As in a five-year production schedule, it takes four years for the film to be made. In January 1990, after the film's voice actors recorded their voices for the characters, animating and filming began through storyboards, pencil tests (rough and clean-up) and ink and paint (the final version of the film) to bring the characters to life, using cameras and recorded audio. James Horner compossed music for the film, including the only song \"Roll Back the Rock (to the Dawn of Time)\" performed by John Goodman. After four years in the making, the film was completely wrapped in the fall of 1993 (the time before the movie's theatrical release on November 24, that year).Actor John Malkovich was originally set to voice the role of Professor Screweyes but dropped out because of disagreements with the animators' vision of the film. Upon the movie's release, Malkovich was a vocal critic of the project, arguing that the scope of the script was not fully realized and that the final product was \"sub par, to say the least.\" To this day, Malkovich generally refuses to talk about the film. In a rare 2003 interview, Malkovich made a brief allusion to the movie, saying, \"Good ideas go to die in Hollywood. I worked on an animated movie about dinosaurs in New York once. It was completely bureaucratized. They took something that had art in it and put it in the laps of people that only cared about the bottom line, and look what happened.\" In a later portion of the interview, Malkovich went on to say, \"Yeah, projects like We're Back: A Dinosaur's Story—they just make you sick. That's why I left this town. It's all about the money, the bottom line. It's disgusting.\"To promote the film's release, a giant helium balloon of Rex the T. Rex was included in the real-life 1993 Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York. Unfortunately, as the parade moved through Columbus Circle, high winds caught the Rex balloon and caused it to lift over the nearby sidewalk. The head of the Rex balloon struck a protruding street light and popped, but the rest of the dinosaur's body remained inflated until the end of the parade.There were also video game adaptations of the movie released for the SNES, Sega Genesis and Game Boy.[1] The Game Boy version was altered in other regions to feature a different IP instead. In Sweden the game featured instead the cartoon character Bamse. In Australia, the game was called Agro Saur and featured the puppet Agro. In Europe, the game featured an original character called Baby T-Rex. A fifth version featuring Edd the Duck was to be released in the UK but was later cancelled.[2]Pizza Hut carried a series of toys.On Rotten Tomatoes the film has a 33% approval rating, based on 15 reviews (5 \"fresh\" and 10 \"rotten\").[3][4] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 2 stars out of 4 and wrote, \"It's shallow and kind of dumb, and the animation is routine, and the story isn't much, and the stakes are a lot higher these days in the featurelength animation game\". Variety's Daniel M. Kimmel gave the film a positive review and wrote, \"In spite of narrative problems... the film's chief appeal is its central conceit -- that giant monsters... can be transformed into creatures who like to play with children\".The film grossed a total of $3,707,770 on its opening weekend and a total domestic gross of $9,315,576 in the United States, resulting in a box office bomb.[5]The laserdisc release was presented in its original widescreen aspect ratio. When the film was released on DVD in some international countries, it was presented in the pan and scan format. However, the widescreen version of the film was once available at Hulu, but was removed. When the film was finally released for the first time ever on DVD in the United States and Canada on May 26, 2009, it was presented in anamorphic widescreen, being Universal/Amblin's first (and so far, only) animated film to be presented in widescreen on a Region 1 DVD (although international DVD releases of An American Tail: Fievel Goes West and Balto were presented in widescreen and some international DVD releases of An American Tail were presented in widescreen), and also Universal's second animated film from the 1990s to be presented in widescreen on a Region 1 DVD (the first being Jetsons: The Movie).This soundtrack included the songs \"Roll Back the Rock (to the Dawn of Time)\" and \"Roll Back the Rock (to the Dawn of Time) (Finale Version) by James Horner, Little Richard and Thomas Dolby.A novelization of the film entitled \"We're Back! Dinosaur's Story: The Novelization\" was later released.","title":"","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c6/We%27re_Back%21_Movie_Poster.jpg/220px-We%27re_Back%21_Movie_Poster.jpg","developer":"","genre":""},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheel_of_Fortune_(video_game)#Genesis.2FSNES_versions","description":"Wheel of Fortune is an American television game show created by Merv Griffin, premiering in 1975 with a syndicated version airing in 1983.

Originally released on May 5, 1992, for the PC operating system DOS, the game was inspired by the 1980s Muse Software video games Castle Wolfenstein and Beyond Castle Wolfenstein. A promotional version of Wolfenstein 3D was released as shareware, which permitted it to be copied widely. The game was later ported to a wide range of computer systems and video game consoles.Wolfenstein 3D was a critical and commercial success. It is widely regarded as having helped popularize the genre on the PC and having established the basic run-and-gun archetype for many subsequent first-person shooter games.Wolfenstein 3D was originally designed to use the same 16-color EGA graphics palette as earlier 3D titles such as Hovertank 3D and Catacomb 3-D. At Scott Miller's suggestion, the team implemented the 256-color VGA graphics palette.[4] Adrian Carmack drew each sprite frame by hand using a computer.[6] Wolfenstein 3D for the PC supports PC speaker, AdLib, Disney Sound Source and Sound Blaster sound effects and Adlib and Sound Blaster for music. This was id Software's first use of digitally sampled sound effects, which were composed by Bobby Prince.[4]The game uses ray casting to render the walls in pseudo-3D. This method emits one ray for each column of pixels, checks to see whether it intersects a wall and draws textures on the screen accordingly, creating a one-dimensional depth buffer against which to clip the scaled sprites that represent enemies, power-ups and props. Before Wolfenstein 3D, id Software had used the technology in 1991 to create Hovertank 3D and Catacomb 3-D for Softdisk. Other games using the Wolfenstein 3D game engine or derivatives of it include Blake Stone, Corridor 7: Alien Invasion, Operation Body Count, Super 3D Noah's Ark and Rise of the Triad.[citation needed]The game's level episode 2, map 8 (E2M8) features a large, hidden \"pushwall\" maze consisting of 181 nearly identical rooms. Depending on the path taken, the player can find treasure, an extra life, a surprise encounter with the Hans Grosse boss or a sign reading \"Call Apogee Say Aardwolf\". This was part of a planned contest in which the first person to find the sign and carry out its instructions would win a prize.[9] While no prize was ever decided, preliminary discussion suggested the prize may have been registered copies of all Apogee games for life.[10] However, because level editors and cheat programs for the game were released within days of the full version of Wolfenstein 3D, many players easily found the sign. Additionally, a cheat code that allowed the player to view all of the in-game sprites, including the \"Aardwolf\" sign was soon discovered and published. As a result, the planned contest was abandoned before it was officially announced or the prize decided upon.[9] The maze and the sign were left in the game as Easter eggs; a text file included with the registered version explained its backstory. The sign was removed in a 1997 commercial re-release by Activision and replaced it with graphics depicting a pile of bones. After completing an episode, the player is given a three-letter code in addition to a total score and time. This was part of a high-score contest that was abandoned for similar reasons to the \"Aardwolf\" one; the code would have been used to verify that a player gained that score without use of cheat codes.[9]Wolfenstein 3D has been commercially ported and sold on over a dozen platforms, ranging from early releases on platforms such as the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) (1993) to newer releases on mobile platforms such as the iPad (2010).[11] Other ports include Mac OS (1994), Atari Jaguar (1994),[11] Acorn Archimedes (1994),[11][12][13] 3DO (1995), Apple IIGS (1998),[11] and the PC-98 (1998). Later releases include the Game Boy Advance (2002), Steam,[14] Xbox Live Arcade and the PlayStation Network (2009), the iPhone[11] and iPod Touch (2009). These ports' sound, graphics and levels may differ from the original but the core gameplay and aesthetic are retained. The source code for the Acorn Archimedes version was released by author Eddie Edwards in 1999.[15][16]By the end of 1993, sales of Wolfenstein 3D had reached over 100,000 units, vastly exceeding the shareware game sales record set by the developer's earlier Commander Keen series and providing id with a higher profit margin than sales of the retail counterpart, Spear of Destiny.[18] Wolfenstein 3D was well received by reviewers upon its release. Computer Gaming World praised the \"sparse [but] gorgeous ... frighteningly realistic ... extremely violent\" graphics and sound, warning \"those sensitive to such things to stay home\". The magazine concluded that Wolfenstein 3D, like Ultima Underworld was \"the first game technologically capable of creating a sufficient element of disbelief-suspension to emotionally immerse the player in a threatening environment\" stating \"I can't remember a game ... evoking such intense psychological responses from its players\".[19] The game twice received 5 out of 5 stars in Dragon in 1993.[20][21] Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the Super NES version a 7 out of 10. They dismissed the censoring in this version as inconsequential and assessed it as a good conversion which retains the good music, huge levels, and overall fun of the PC game.[22] GamePro gave the Jaguar version a rave review, saying Wolfenstein 3D \"set a new standard for PC gaming\" and that the Jaguar version was the best to date, including the PC version. They elaborated that the graphics are detailed with minimal pixelation, the digitized voices are clear, and \"The fast, intense action is slowed only by the Jaguar's cumbersome control pad.\"[23]More recently, Colin Williamson of Allgame awarded Wolfenstein 3D 4½ out of 5 stars[24] and Marc Golding of HonestGamers gave it 7 out of 10.[25] Both modern reviews praised the game's moody soundtrack, evocative sound design and tense gameplay. Golding said players may struggle to remain interested in the game because its sixty levels are similar to each other.[25] A 2009 review by Daemon Hatfield of IGN gave the PlayStation 3 version of the game a score of 8 out of 10, calling it \"required playing for any first-person shooter fan\" that \"remains fun after all these years\". He also said that \"it's definitely dated and flawed, but this is a game you play for its nostalgic value\".[26]Wolfenstein 3D won the 1993 \"Best Action/Arcade Game\" award at the Shareware Industry Awards,[27] and a Codie award from the Software Publishing Association for Best Action/Arcade Game. It was the first shareware game to win a Codie, and id (with six employees) the smallest company to receive the award.[28] Wolfenstein 3D was nominated for an award at the 1993 Game Developers Conference.[29] It was included on Computer Gaming World's list of the 150 Best Games of All Time\" in 1996,[30] on IGN's list of the Top 100 Games of All Time in 2003[31] and 2007,[32] and on G4's list of Top 100 Video Games of All Time in 2012.[33]The game's version of the Nazi leader Adolf Hitler was proclaimed the 15th greatest boss in video game history by The Phoenix in 2006;[34] the encounter with Hitler was also recognized as an exceptional boss fight by 1UP.com in 2009,[35] and ranked as the 50th hardest boss battle in video game history by Complex in 2013.[36] In 2011, PlayStation Universe featured killing Hitler in Wolfenstein 3D in the first article of a retrospective series \"Unforgettable Gaming Moments\".[37] GamesRadar put 'Mecha-Hitler' in their 2013 list of the best villains in video game history at number 23, calling it \"one of the most nonsensically funny boss encounters in gaming.\"[38]Wolfenstein 3D has been called the \"grandfather of 3D shooters\",[40] specifically first-person shooters, because it established the fast-paced action and technical prowess commonly expected in the genre and increased the genre's popularity.[24][25][31][40][41] It has also been acknowledged that it confirmed shareware distribution as a serious and profitable business strategy.[18][40] The release of id Software's hit game Doom in 1993 was an additional impetus for a wave of similar games, most of which were distributed using the same shareware strategy as Wolfenstein 3D.[citation needed]According to Ronald Strickland, Wolfenstein 3D introduced a fresh formula that blended together disparate elements from computer and arcade game genres to the PC game market. It combined the fast pace and quick reflexes of arcade action games that pit the player against multiple enemies that come in increasing waves of speed and complexity, with the first-person perspective of some early role-playing video games such as Wizardry, which tried to provide players with an immersive experience.[42][43] While prior computer shooter games were most often scrolling shooters, Wolfenstein 3D helped move the market towards first-person shooters.[44]Although id Software had not designed Wolfenstein 3D to be editable or modified by players, users developed character and level editors to create original alterations to the game's content. These efforts influenced id Software to design later titles like Doom and Quake to be easily modifiable for the end user.[45] The game's source code was published by id Software on July 21, 1995,[46] while the artwork data, music and software tools of the game remain under copyright. Bethesda Softworks, whose parent company bought id Software in 2009, celebrated the 20th anniversary of Wolfenstein 3D '​s release by making available a free-to-play, browser-based version of the game on its website on May 5, 2012.[47] The first level of Wolfenstein 3D is included as an easter egg and playable in Wolfenstein: The New Order however the level maintains the gameplay mechanics and player/weapon design of The New Order.[48][49]Wolfenstein 3D was followed by several games based on its protagonist and settings:","title":"Wolfenstein 3D","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/05/Wolfenstein-3d.jpg","developer":"id Software","genre":"First-person shooter"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverine:_Adamantium_Rage","description":"","title":"Wolverine Adamantium Rage","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/dc/Wolverine_Adamantium_Rage.jpg/250px-Wolverine_Adamantium_Rage.jpg","developer":"Teeny Weeny Games","genre":"Action"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wordtris","description":"Wordtris, stylized as WORDTЯIS, is a Tetris offshoot designed by Alexey Pajitnov and published by Spectrum Holobyte in 1991 for the IBM PC platform.

It was originally released for the Neo Geo MVS arcade cabinet on July 28, 1992. It is ADK's first game in the fighting game genre, as well as their earliest attempt in the fighting game trend of the '90s that was popularized by Capcom's 1991 arcade-hit Street Fighter II. It was even the last game with the \"Alpha\" logo labeled within the game before the developer became \"ADK\"; however, the \"Alpha\" logo was last used on one of the arcade flyers of its sequel.Due to its success in the market, World Heroes was followed by a sequel released less than a year later titled World Heroes 2.World Heroes is controlled with three of the four buttons (\"A\" to punch, \"B\" to kick and \"C\" to throw) used along with an 8-way joystick on the Neo Geo MVS arcade cabinet. The punches and kicks have two levels, weak and strong. In order to get each strength with just two buttons, the punch and kick buttons have to be pressed briefly for weak and longer for strong. This same mechanic even can be performed with special moves. The throw button C, if close enough to the opponent, grabs and throws the opponent across the stage; however, if holding the joystick in the opposite direction at the right time, the opponent would be tossed the opposite direction. Introduced in the fighting game genre by World Heroes are some abilities exclusive to some characters that were used in several later fighting games, such as multi-jumping using Hanzou and Fuuma, and shooting projectiles from the air using Rasputin.World Heroes was later ported to the Neo Geo AES in both Japan and North America on September 11, 1992, which is identical to the Neo Geo MVS version, but designed for home gaming, just like nearly every AES versions of Neo Geo titles. World Heroes was later ported to the Neo Geo CD exclusively in Japan by ADK on March 17, 1995, which is the same as the MVS and AES versions, but with arranged background music. Besides SNK's consoles, it was first ported by Sunsoft to the SNES in Japan on August 12, 1993, in North America in September 1993, and PAL regions in 1993. Later, it was ported to the Sega Mega Drive / Genesis by Sega Midwest Studio (then known as Sega Midwest Development Division[3]) exclusively in North America on August 16, 1994. The Neo Geo AES version was also added to the Wii's Virtual Console first in Japan on September 28, 2007, then in North America on October 8, 2007, and in Europe on October 19, 2007. Later, it was added to a compilation of Neo Geo arcade games for the PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable and Wii titled SNK Arcade Classics Vol. 1 as an unlockable game.[4] A port was in development for the Mega-CD/Sega CD by Funcom, under the title World Heroes CD, but was cancelled prior to its release.[citation needed]On October 18, 2007, SNK Playmore added it with its three sequels to the arcade game compilation World Heroes Gorgeous: Neo Geo Online Collection Vol. 9 (ワールドヒーローズ ゴージャス?) in Japan for the PlayStation 2. It was later published in North America on March 11, 2008, and in Europe on November 7, 2008, both titled as World Heroes Anthology.

However, the \"C\" button can either be used to throw when close enough to the opponent, or taunt against the opponent. New additions include six new characters, new and modified moves and fighting statistics added to the original eight playable characters returning from the first World Heroes, projectile-reflecting, counter-grabbing and a slightly faster movement. There are fourteen playable characters in all.In \"Normal Game\" mode, the object is to first defeat all six playable characters introduced in World Heroes 2, then defeat four of the original eight characters introduced in the original World Heroes chosen by the game randomly. After that, the player must defeat the two bosses, Neo Geegus and Dio to win the game. The rule in each battle against a character, like in most fighting games at the time of its release, requires the players to win two-of three rounds to completely win against the opponent. If the timer runs out before anyone is knocked out, the one with the most health in his/her lifebars wins.World Heroes 2 was later ported to the Neo Geo AES in both Japan and North America on June 4, 1993, which is identical to the Neo Geo MVS version, but designed for home gaming, just like nearly every AES versions of Neo Geo titles.

It features a mixture of arranged and chiptune BGM (different compared to the Neo-Geo CD version's BGM), as well as nearly identical graphics, sound effects and voice samples to the original Neo Geo versions. Later, World Heroes 2 was ported and published by Saurus to the SNES in Japan on July 1, 1994, while this specific port was later published in North America by Takara in September 1994.

It is the first game in the Worms series of video games and was initially only available for the Amiga. Later it was ported to other platforms.Worms is a turn based game where a player controls a team of worms against other teams of worms that are controlled by a computer or human opponent. The aim is to use various weapons to kill the worms on the other teams and have the last surviving worm(s).Worms is a turn based artillery game, similar to other early games in the genre such as Scorched Earth.During the development of Worms 2, Andy Davidson wrote Worms – The Director's Cut, a special edition produced exclusively for the Amiga. Only 5000 copies were ever sold. It was also the last version released for the Commodore Amiga platform from which the game originated.In 1995, Team 17 began development on a port of Worms to Nintendo's portable game console the Virtual Boy. The game was to be published by Ocean, but was canceled only weeks into development as a result of Nintendo's discontinuation of the console.[6]Worms is the first in the Worms series of games. A remake, also called Worms, for the Xbox 360 was released in 2007. It has since been released to the PS3, in April 2009, and on the iPhone on July 11, 2009.Worms Reinforcements (1996) is an expansion pack for Worms, which was later amalgamated with the original game to create Worms and Reinforcements United (a.k.a. Worms United or Worms Utd.) the same year. Released only for the PC, it added a single player campaign and the ability to add custom levels and soundpacks (which was already available for the Amiga version). It also included an introductory FMV.Worms: The Director's Cut (1997) is a sequel to Worms, available only on the Amiga. It is largely built upon the original Amiga game engine with various gameplay enhancement and additions, as well as graphical improvements and fixes.Sega Saturn Magazine gave the Saturn version a 90%. They especially praised Worms's unexpected complexity and the fun of multiplayer mode, and called it \"Quite simply the most playable game to hit the Saturn so far.\"[5] The four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the Saturn version an average of 8.625 out of 10, commenting that \"Some games have great graphics and control, but Worms doesn't need either because the fun factor is a 10+. With multiplayer ability of up to four people, Worms is one of those games that is so unique, it doesn't fit into any category - except innovative and incredibly addictive.\"[7] GameSpot scored the PC version a 7.6/10. They criticized the slowness of large multiplayer sessions and the imprecision of the keyboard controls, but like Sega Saturn Magazine, they lauded the combination of surface simplicity and underlying complexity, summarizing that \"Like the board game Othello, Worms takes only a few minutes to learn, but may take a lifetime to master.\"[8]","title":"Worms","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/d7/Worms-win-cover.jpg","developer":"Team17","genre":"Artillery"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWF_Raw_(video_game)","description":"","title":"WWF Raw","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4e/WWFRAW.png/220px-WWFRAW.png","developer":"Sculptured Software","genre":"Fighting"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWF_Royal_Rumble","description":"WWF Royal Rumble is a professional wrestling video game released by LJN in 1993 for the Super NES and Sega Genesis.

Players may strike their opponent with steel chairs found outside the ring. After knocking the referee temporarily unconscious, one may use illegal tactics such as choking and eye raking. To better avoid losing via count out, wrestlers may also roll into the ring from the bottom side; ring entry was previously only possible through the left and right sides.

Additionally, the game had a role-playing element where experience points could be accrued by defeating enemies and bosses, and each level up increased the player's maximum life and special ability points.Eventually, one of the robot forms is replaced by Xardion, which combines the abilities of all three previous forms and exceeds them.

It spawned a sequel, Ghoul Patrol, released in 1994. In 2009, Zombies Ate My Neighbors was re-released for the Virtual Console to positive reviews.Zombies Ate My Neighbors was originally developed by LucasArts. It was published by Konami, a company already known for platformers in 1993.[4] Music for the game was composed by Joseph \"Joe\" McDermott. The ZAMN engine would later be used for Ghoul Patrol, Metal Warriors and Big Sky Trooper.[5] The developer wanted to include battery save in the game but was unable to as they could not afford it.[6]Although not an immediate success, Zombies Ate My Neighbors became a cult classic years after its release.[3][11] Upon its release, it got above average praise, earning an 84.5% on Gamerankings.com.[10] Reviewers of the game often cited its humor, two-player mode, graphics and music as some of its best aspects.Upon the game's release for the Wii Virtual Console, Zombies Ate My Neighbors received immense praise and earned an Editor's Choice Award from IGN.[11] The game has been regarded as one of \"the most requested additions to the VC system even before the Wii launch\".[11][13] Comparisons to the game Dead Rising, released for the Xbox 360 in 2006, have been drawn, Lucas Thomas of IGN saying \"Zombies Ate My Neighbors is basically a comical 16-bit template for the new Xbox 360 release, Dead Rising.

Originally, Ghoul Patrol was not intended to be released as a sequel to Zombies Ate My Neighbors, but was re-worked as such to increase sales. In 1997, LucasArts released a game for Sony's PlayStation and Sega's Sega Saturn titled Herc's Adventures, which uses the same basic gameplay format and mechanics as Zombies Ate My Neighbors, but instead parodies ancient Greek mythology. Maniac Mansion: Day of the Tentacle, another game developed by LucasArts, is referenced in Zombies Ate My Neighbors through a secret level.[15]","title":"Zombies Ate My Neighbors","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/75/Zombies_Ate_My_Neighbors_box.jpg/220px-Zombies_Ate_My_Neighbors_box.jpg","developer":"LucasArts","genre":"Run and gun"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zool","description":"Zool: Ninja of the Nth Dimension is a video game originally produced for the Amiga by Gremlin Graphics in 1992.","title":"Zool: Ninja of the Nth Dimension","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/13/Zool_cover.jpg/250px-Zool_cover.jpg","developer":"Gremlin Graphics","genre":"Platformer"},{"fonte":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoop","description":"Zoop is a puzzle game developed by Hookstone Productions and published by Viacom New Media.Some of its rules resemble those of the arcade game Plotting (known in some territories as Flipull), but unlike Plotting, Zoop runs in real time.Official Zoop games have been released for Game Boy, Game Gear, Mega Drive/Genesis, SNES, Atari Jaguar, Sega Saturn, PlayStation, DOS, and Macintosh.","title":"Zoop","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/7a/Zoop_Cover.png","developer":"Hookstone Productions","genre":""}]
